METHODS: This open-\nlabel, investigator-initiated, phase 3, randomized trial was conducted from 2012 to 2018. Adult patients with locally advanced head \nand neck cancer who were fit for radical chemoradiation were randomized 1:1 to receive either radical radiotherapy (66-70 grays) \nwith concurrent weekly cisplatin (30 mg/m2) (CRT) or the same schedule of CRT with weekly nimotuzumab (200 mg) (NCRT).\nThe primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); key secondary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS), duration of  \nlocoregional control (LRC), and overall survival (OS). An intent-to-treat analysis also was performed. RESULTS: In total, 536 patients \nwere allocated equally to both treatment arms. The median follow-up was 39.13 months. The addition of nimotuzumab improved PFS \n(hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.89; P  = .004), LRC (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50-0.89; P  = .006), and DFS (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-\n0.92; P = .008) and had a trend toward improved OS (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65-1.08; P  = .163). Grade 3 through 5 adverse events were \nsimilar between the 2 arms, except for a higher incidence of mucositis in the NCRT arm (66.7% vs 55.8%; P  = .01). CONCLUSIONS: \nThe addition of nimotuzumab to concurrent weekly CRT improves PFS, LRC, and DFS. This combination provides a novel alternative \ntherapeutic option to a 3-weekly schedule of 100 mg/m2 cisplatin in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer who are \ntreated with radical-intent CRT.

Adult patients with newly diagnosed, treatment-\nnaive, nonmetastatic, stage III or IV LAHNSCC aris -\ning in the oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx, or oral cavity were eligible. The other eligibility criteria were \na Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 and adequate he -\nmatologic, renal, and hepatic function. Patients with tumors originating in the nasopharynx, salivary gland, \nor nasal cavity and those who had received immuno -\ntherapy or prior radiotherapy to the head and neck re -\ngion were excluded. The study protocol was approved by \nthe Institutional Ethics Committee and was registered \nwith the Clinical Trial Registry of India (trial registration \nidentifier CTRI/2014/09/004980). It was conducted ac -\ncording to the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice guidelines, and it was monitored by the TMC \nData Safety and Monitoring Committee.\nStudy Procedures\nBefore randomization, patients underwent a comprehen -\nsive head and neck examination, blood tests (complete \nhemogram, renal function, and liver function), imaging of \nthe head and neck region (either contrast-enhanced com -\nputed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), chest radiogram, electrocardiogram, and pure tone audiometry. \nPatients were staged according to the American Joint \nCommittee on Cancer-Union for International Cancer Control staging system (seventh edition). Patients with a lymph node status ≥ N2 underwent whole-body positron \nemission tomography-computed tomography to rule out distant metastasis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) status \nwas examined in the tissue biopsy using immunohisto -\nchemistry for p16.\n14 All patients had nutritional, speech, \nswallowing, and dental assessments, and deficiencies noted were managed accordingly. Stratified block, cen -\ntral randomization for 5 factors was performed by an  independent statistician, and patients were randomized \n1:1 to either the cisplatin-radiation arm (CRT) or the  \nnimotuzumab plus cisplatin-radiation arm (NCRT). These factors were site of malignancy (oropharynx vs \nothers), stage (stage III vs IV), age ( ≤60 vs > 60 years), \n radiation technique (conventional vs others), and treat -\nment center.\nHigh-dose, curative radiotherapy was administered \nin both arms over 6.5 to 7 weeks. Irradiation was planned \nusing a standard 2-dimensional technique, a 3-  dimensional  \nconformal technique, or intensity-modulated radiother -\napy with megavoltage radiation. Gross tumor and lymph \nnode disease received 70 grays (Gy), in 2 Gy per fraction, \n5 days per week. Uninvolved nodal regions of the neck \nwere treated to a dose of 46 to 50 Gy. Other altered frac -\ntionation schedules were permitted if the biologic equiva -\nlent dose for tumor control was similar to 70 Gy at 2 Gy \nper fraction. Quality assurance was done before com -\nmencement and during radiation treatment; plans and \ndoses were cross-checked and confirmed by the radiation \noncology study members (for protocol, see supporting \n information [Clinical Therapy Protocol, Appendix IV]).\nIn both arms, cisplatin was dosed at 30 mg/m\n2 \nweekly during radiation along with supportive medi -\ncation. Nimotuzumab was administered weekly in the \nNCRT arm intravenously as a 200-mg flat dose in 250 mL \nnormal saline over 60 minutes without premedication. \nPatients underwent a comprehensive clinical examina -\ntion and positron emission tomography-computed tomography 8 weeks after the completion of chemora -\ndiation. If residual or recurrent disease was  resectable, \nthese patients were offered surgical resection. Wherever feasible, residual, progressive, or recurrent disease was \npathologically confirmed. Patients who were not willing \nto undergo surgery or who had unresectable disease were \noffered palliative chemotherapy.\nStudy Endpoints\nPFS was the primary outcome and was defined as  duration \nfrom the date of randomization to the date of progres -\nsion (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid \n 10970142, 2019, 18, Downloaded from https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.32179 by INASP/HINARI - INDONESIA, Wiley Online Library on [30/10/2022].

Secondary  outcomes \nwere locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival \n(DFS), OS, treatment compliance, adverse events, and \nquality of life. Duration of LRC was defined as the \ntime between the date of randomization and the date \nof  locoregional failure. DFS was defined as the period \nafter treatment completion when the patient experienced complete remission. For patients who achieved complete  \nremission after therapy, DFS was calculated from the date of response assessment to the date of recurrence (either \nlocoregional or distant). For patients with residual dis -\nease who underwent salvage surgery, DFS was calculated from date of salvage surgery to the date of recurrence. \nIn all other patients, DFS was considered zero. OS was \ncalculated as the time from the date of randomization to \nthe date of death. Adverse events were graded according \nto the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology \nCriteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03).\nSample Size\nA 2-year PFS rate of 60% in the CRT arm was  \nassumed.16,17 With an α of 5%, power of 80%, and a \ndropout rate of 10%, we required 536 patients in the \nstudy to demonstrate an absolute increase in PFS by \n12%. An interim analysis without an α spending func -\ntion for monitoring early efficacy was planned after 4 years. However, it was never performed because the \nstudy recruited slowly.\nStatistical Methods\nThe statistical software packages R (version 3.1.2;  \nR Foundation for Statistical Computing) and SPSS (ver -\nsion 20; SPSS Inc) were used for analysis. Outcomes were \nanalyzed using the intention-to-treat method. Median \nfollow-up was calculated using the reverse Kaplan-Meier \nmethod. Descriptive statistics were performed for base -\nline characteristics, treatment compliance, locoregional response, and adverse events. These were compared be -\ntween the 2 groups using either the chi-square test or the Fisher test. PFS, DFS, LRC, and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Brookmeyer and \nCrowley method was used for the construction of 95% \nCIs, and time-to-event curves were compared using the \nlog rank test. A Cox proportional hazard model with the \nEfron method of tie handling was used for calculating \nthe hazard rate with 95% CIs. The proportional hazard \nmodel assumptions were checked using Schoenfeld resid -\nuals. A P value ≤ .05 was considered as significant.\nA post hoc sensitivity analysis was performed using  \n2 methods. The first method was a competing risk analysis for PFS, DFS, and LRC, and the second method was a \nrepeat analysis using a composite endpoint  (inclusive of \ndeath) for PFS (progression or death), LRC  (locoregional \nprogression or death), and DFS (progression or death) \nto confirm the robustness of the results. A multivariate \nanalysis was performed for PFS, DFS, LRC, and OS with \nknown prognostic factors (age, site of malignancy, stage, \nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance sta -\ntus, and radiation technique) using Cox regression anal -\nysis. Because HPV status is an important prognostic \nfactor in oropharyngeal cancers, we performed a post hoc subgroup analysis to address the effect of the interaction \n between nimotuzumab and HPV status on outcomes.\nRESULTS\nBaseline Characteristics\nBetween 2012 and 2018, 536 patients were randomized \nequally between both arms (268 in each). The median \nduration of follow-up was 39.13 months (39.5 months \nin the CRT arm vs 39.0 months in the NCRT arm). \nThe Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials flow \ndiagram in Figure 1 provides the details of enrollment, \nallocation of intervention, follow-up, and data analysis. \nBaseline patient and tumor characteristics were balanced \nbetween the arms (Table 1).\nAdverse Events\nAll adverse events occurred with similar frequency in the \n2 arms except mucositis and thrombocytopenia (Table 2). \nHospitalization because of toxicities was higher in the \nNCRT arm (58 patients; 21.6%) versus the CRT arm (41 \npatients; 15.3%; P = .058). Nasogastric tubes were placed \nin 97 patients (36.2%) in CRT arm versus 102 patients (38.1%) in the NCRT arm ( P = .655).\nTreatment\nThe details of radiation and chemotherapy compli -\nance are shown in Table 3. A cumulative cisplatin dose ≥200 mg/m\n2 was administered to 211 patients (78.7%) \nin the CRT arm and to 208 patients (77.6%) in the NCRT arm ( P = .754).\nOutcomes\nProgression-free survival\nTwo hundred thirty-five patients experienced disease \nprogression, including 134 in the CRT arm and 101 in \nthe NCRT arm. The sites of progression in the CRT \narm were locoregional in 105 patients (39.2%), distant \nin 24 patients (9%), and both in 5 patients (1.9%).

The 2-year PFS was 50.1% (95% CI, 43.7-56.2) in the CRT arm and 61.8% (95% CI, 55.2-67.7) in the NCRT arm. The addition of nimotuzumab \nled to a consistent benefit across all subgroups (Fig. 2). \nThe results of the sensitivity analysis using compet -\ning risk analysis ( P = .003; Gray test ) and the com -\nposite endpoint of progression or death (hazard ratio,  Figure 1.

The 2-year OS was 63.8% (95% CI, 57.3%-\n69.6%) and 57.7% (95% CI, 51.3%-63.6%) in the NCRT and CRT arms, respectively. Details of causes \nof deaths in each arm are shown in Table 4. The impact \nof nimotuzumab on various subgroups is depicted in \nFigure 4; and, for patients who received a cumulative \ncisplatin dose ≥ 200 mg/m\n2, the impact was similar to \nthat in the overall results (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.62-1.13; P = .237). The impact of various prognostic \nfactors on OS is shown in the supporting information (see Supporting Table 1). Among the tested factors, the \npresence of stage III disease ( P = .001) was associated \nwith improved OS.\nSalvage Surgery for Residual Disease\nObjective responses postchemoradiation were evaluable in 239 patients (89.2%) in the CRT arm and 233 pa -\ntients (86.9%) in the NCRT arm ( P = .424). The over -\nall response rate among evaluable patients was 89.1% \n(n = 213) in the CRT arm versus 89.3% (n = 208) in the \nNCRT arm. A complete response post-treatment com -\npletion was documented in 62.7% of patients in the CRT \narm (n = 168) and in 61.6% of patients (n = 165) in \nthe NCRT arm. Salvage surgery for residual disease was \nplanned in the multidisciplinary clinic for 72  patients, \nincluding 34 in the CRT am and 38 in the NCRT arm. Of the 34 patients in the CRT arm, 22 underwent sal -\nvage surgery, 5 progressed before salvage surgery, and  \n7 patients refused surgery. The 22 salvage surgeries per -\nformed were neck lymph node dissection in 16 patients, local excision in 2 patients, and both local excision and \nneck lymph node dissection in 4 patients. Of the 38 \n patients in the NCRT arm, 26 underwent salvage sur -\ngery, 5 progressed before salvage surgery, and 7 patients refused surgery. The 26 salvage surgeries performed were \nneck lymph node dissection in 13 patients, local exci -\nsion in 1 patient, and both local excision and neck lymph node dissection in 12 patients.\nHPV Status and Outcomes\nThe HPV status of oropharyngeal cancers is shown in \nTable 1. There was a significant interaction between HPV \nstatus and treatment outcomes (see Supporting Table 2). \nThe hazard ratio for PFS in p16-negative oropharyngeal \ncancers was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.36-0.79), whereas hazard \nratio for p16-positive cancers was 2.6 (95% CI, 0.57-11.9). \nThe 2-year PFS was 31.5% (95% CI, 21.5%-42.0%) in \nthe CRT arm and 57.2% (95% CI, 45.8%-67.1%) in the \nNCRT arm in patients with p16-negative oropharyngeal \ncancers ( P = .001). A similar higher magnitude of  benefit \nwas observed with regard to DFS (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.82; P = .006), LRC (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI,  \n0.4-0.94; P = .024), and OS (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% \nCI, 0.43-0.92; P = .018). The 2-year OS was 39%  \n(95% CI, 28.3%-49.6%) in the CRT arm and 57.6% (95% CI, 46.3%-67.4%) in the NCRT arm in patients \nwith p16-negative oropharyngeal cancers.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this first phase 3 study with nimotuzumab, we found \nthat its addition to cisplatin prolonged PFS compared \nwith cisplatin alone in patients with LAHNSCC who \n received radical chemoradiation. The addition of nimo -\ntuzumab improved 2-year PFS and decreased the haz -\nard of progression by 31%. Similar benefits also were \nobserved in the time to LRC and DFS. The improve -\nment in OS was not significant. However, OS was not the primary endpoint of the study, and data currently are \nimmature for this comparison.\nStudies have shown that EGFR antibodies did not \nimprove outcomes when added to cisplatin in patients TABLE 4.

In that study, subgroup analysis \nrevealed that the addition of cetuximab led to a trend \ntoward improved outcomes in young patients, those with \nHPV-negative tumors of the oropharynx or hypopharynx, \nand the T4 subgroup. However, the proportion of these \n patients in RTOG 0522 was in the minority. Seventy per -\ncent of patients in that study had primary tumors in the \n oropharynx, and only 27% of these were HPV-negative. \nThe hypopharynx as a site of primary malignancy was \n present in 6.9% of patients. Compared with those find -\nings, in our study, these characteristics were present in the  \nmajority of patients (Table 1). Our post hoc subgroup \nanalysis in p16-  negative patients further strengthened \nthis assumption. The use of nimotuzumab in this cohort  \nof patients led to a decrease in the risk of progression \nby nearly 50%, which translated into a decrease in the \nrisk of death by 37%. Hence we believe that our results \necho the findings of the RTOG 0522 subgroup analy -\nsis and the  recently reported GORTEC (the French  \nHead and Neck Radiation Oncology Group) study,18 \nsuggesting that younger patients and those with  adverse \nprognostic features typically benefit from the nimo -\ntuzumab-weekly cisplatin concurrent combination (lighter CRT). Second, in the RTOG 0522 study, con -\ncurrent cetuximab with cisplatin led to more  adverse \nevents, which, in turn, led to more toxicity-related  \nradiation interruptions (26.9% vs 15.1%, respectively).\n9 \nRadiation interruptions and delays during concurrent chemoradiation are known adverse prognostic factors.\n19 \nThird, nimotuzumab is molecularly and biologically different from cetuximab\n20 and panitumumab.21 Drugs \nwith similar mechanisms of action are known to have differential impacts.\n22 Nimotuzumab inhibits both \n ligand-dependent and ligand-independent signaling of \nthe EGFR pathway.23\nThe control arm in our study demonstrated a 3-year \nPFS of 45.8%, which appears to be lower than the rates in other similar randomized studies from North America \n(which has a predominant HPV-positive population) but \nsimilar to the rates in HPV-negative cohorts in the litera -\nture.\n9,24-27 Furthermore, our patients had a high propor -\ntion of hypopharyngeal primaries, high rates of tobacco use (86.5%), and almost one-fifth had gross perinodal \nextension, all of which are recognized adverse prognostic \nfeatures.\n28-31\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network guide -\nlines recommend 3-weekly or weekly cisplatin as standard treatment options.32 We used weekly cispla -\ntin in this study, and it is used worldwide, especially in head and neck cancer-endemic regions ( >85% of \ncenters), at doses from 30 to 40 mg/m\n2.33-37 This use \nas routine practice is reflected in Asian guidelines,38 \nIndian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guide -\nlines,39 the evidence-based guidelines of TMC,40 and \nin multiple randomized studies from this region.33,34,36 \nWe reported a benefit of 3-weekly cisplatin over weekly cisplatin. However, this benefit was predominantly \n applicable in the adjuvant setting and for oral cavity \ncancer and is not applicable to the patients in the cur -\nrent study.\n41\nA cumulative cisplatin dose of 200 mg/m2 provides \nadequate antitumor effects.41 In the Meta-Analysis of \nChemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer (MACH-NC) \nanalysis, among the variety of monocisplatin schedules \ncombined with radiation, negative results were obtained \nonly in a single study, which used a cumulative cispla -\ntin dose of 140 mg/m2, a dose much below the desired \nlevel of 200 mg/m2.3,42 Similar findings were echoed in \na meta-analysis reported by Ghi et al,43 who found no \ndifference in the hazard rate of death between groups \nof patients who received cumulative doses of cisplatin \n≤300  mg/m2. However, the hazard rate was markedly \nincreased when the cumulative dose of cisplatin was \n<150 mg/m2 compared with cisplatin doses between \n200 and 225 mg/m2.43 The proportion of patients who \n received cumulative dose of cisplatin ≥ 200 mg/m2 in the \ncurrent study was 78.7% in the CRT arm and 77.6% \nin the NCRT arm (Table 3). The corresponding rate in \nthe RTOG studies and in other major studies ranged \n between 62.5% and 88.5%.5,9,44,45 Furthermore, a post \nhoc analysis confirmed that the benefit seen with nimo -\ntuzumab also was observed in patients who received \n cisplatin ≥200 mg/m2.\nAdverse event rates were similar between the 2 \narms except for a higher incidence of grade ≥3 mucosi -\ntis, which was seen with the addition of nimotuzumab. \nHowever, this did not hamper the treatment delivery. The \nlack of EGFR-specific side effects is courtesy of its lower \naffinity for EGFR receptor and hence a higher specificity \nfor tumor binding because as it has a higher density of \nEGFR receptor than skin and other normal organs.46,47\nThere are certain limitations in this study. This \nwas a single-center study, and the accrual took 6 years. However, no major changes have occurred over the last \ndecade in chemoradiation for head and neck cancers. \nThe stratification was not according to HPV status. \nThe incidence is low in the Indian population (range, \n 10970142, 2019, 18, Downloaded from https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.32179 by INASP/HINARI - INDONESIA, Wiley Online Library on [30/10/2022].

There were disproportionately higher numbers of hypopharyngeal cancers (which carry a poor prognosis) in the NCRT arm, but this does not affect the study conclusions. The dose of 100 mg/m\n2 3 weekly \nwas not used as a standard, hence the additional impact of nimotuzumab with this dose remains unknown.\nThe radiation schedules and techniques in this study \nwere standard; therefore, these results are generalizable, especially in centers where weekly cisplatin radiosensiti -\nzation is used.\n49 The follow-up for OS is immature, hence \nthe data for OS need to be interpreted with caution.\nConclusion\nThe addition of nimotuzumab to concurrent weekly cis -\nplatin and chemoradiotherapy improves PFS, LRC, and DFS. Three-weekly cisplatin with radiotherapy remains the preferred option of treatment, and this combination provides a novel alternative therapeutic option when weekly cisplatin is used.\nFUNDING SUPPORT\nThis study was funded by Biocon Ltd, Science and Engineering Research \nBoard grant EMR/2015/001591, and by the Tata Memorial Center Research Administration Council.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES\nSameer Vasant Chaudhari is an employee of Biocon Ltd and reports per -\nsonal fees and nonfinancial support from the company outside the submit -\nted work.

In addition, cetuximab concurrent with \nRT regimen was associated with a higher rate of ≥3 AEs than RT, suggesting that the \nrecommendation grade in future NCCN guidelines needs to be adjusted or removed\nCIMa Her  \nnimotuzumab 50 mg Systematic Review of R/M SCCHN Treatment Options\nIn summary, IMT (Immunotherapy) appears to be paving the frontier of R/M HNSCC \ntreatment  but its routine use is hindered by its expense and the challenge of selecting \npatients who will truly benefit .

Since most patients present with advanced disease,\npalliative chemotherapy remains the treatment of choice [ 2,3].\nWith standard gemcitabine (gem), median survival in patients\nwith advanced disease is under 6 months [ 4]. The combination of\ngem with numerous cytotoxic and targeted agents did not gener-ally lead to a survival beneﬁt. Recent meta-analyses in patientswith metastatic pancreatic cancer indicate improvements in over-all survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for some\ncombination therapies [ 5,6] as 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin plus\nirinotecan plus oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) or nab-paclitaxelplus gem [ 7,8].\nIn terms of targeted therapies, only erlotinib, an inhibitor of\nthe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), added to gemshowed a marginal survival beneﬁt of 2 weeks [ 9].\nEnhanced EGFR expression occurs in both primary and meta-\nstatic pancreatic cancer in about 30%–70% of the patients [ 10],\nalthough no obvious impact of EGFR expression on survival rateswas observed [ 9]. The combination of cetuximab with gem failed\nto be more effective than gem alone [ 11].\nNimotuzumab (nimo) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal anti-\nbody against the extracellular domain of EGFR that mediates\nanti-tumor effects by its capacity to inhibit proliferation, survival\nand angiogenesis [ 12,13]. In contrast to other EGFR inhibitors,\nnimo has a very low toxicity proﬁle, which was demonstrated inprevious phase I/II studies [ 13,14]. An explanation for the low\nincidence of skin rash has emerged from several experimentalstudies. Antibodies with an intermediate afﬁnity for EGFR have a\nhigher ratio of accumulation in tissues with higher EGFR expres-\nsion levels (i.e. tumors) when compared with healthy tissues [ 15].\nIn contrast to cetuximab, the binding properties of nimotuzumabwere strongly dependent on the EGFR expression levels of tumorcells [ 13]. These ﬁndings support a greater beneﬁt of nimotuzu-\nmab in EGFR overexpressing tumors [ 18,19].\nSafety, efﬁcacy and pharmacokinetics of nimo have already\nbeen examined in a phase II trial of patients with locally advanced\nor metastatic pancreatic cancer. The dose of 400 mg was deﬁnedfor further clinical development because of pharmacokineticlimitations. Six out of the 36 patients assessable for responseshowed stable disease (median PFS 19.2 weeks). The onlytreatment-related adverse event was rash CTC grade 1 in 5 pa-\ntients [ 16], apart from constitutional symptoms possibly related\nto the underlying disease. This randomized, placebo-controlledstudy analyzes the efﬁcacy and safety of nimo in combinationwith gem for the ﬁrst-line treatment patients with advanced ormetastatic pancreatic cancer.\nPatients and methods\nStudy design\nThis multi-institutional, placebo-controlled, randomized phase IIb trial\nwas sponsored by Oncoscience AG, Wedel, Germany, with patients\nincluded into the trial between 2007 and 2011. Data were collected by the\nsponsor and were analyzed by a bio-statistician (CRM Biometrics\nGmbH, Rheinbach, Germany). An independent data and safety monitor-\ning committee reviewed efﬁcacy and safety data. The study was done inaccordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave their writ-\nten informed consent. The institutional ethic committees at each site re-\nviewed and approved the protocol. The study sponsor had no role in the\nstudy design, analysis, interpretation, writing, or the decision to submit\nfor publication. The senior author had full access to all study data andﬁnal responsibility for the publication.\nPatients\nChemotherapy-naı ¨ve patients with locally advanced or metastatic pan-\ncreatic cancer were eligible for this multi-institutional, randomized trial\nif they had histologically or cytologically conﬁrmed locally advanced ormetastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas not amenable to curative\nradiotherapy or surgery. Patients with measurable disease as deﬁned by\nResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 and\nsufﬁcient organ functions were evaluated by the respective laboratory\nand imaging tests, and physical examinations. Patients had to be at least18 years of age, with a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) /C2170%, and an\nestimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Patients were excluded if\nthey had any prior anticancer chemotherapy including adjuvant gem for\npancreatic cancer, any investigational agent received concurrently or\nwithin the last 30 days, major surgery within the previous 3 weeks, symp-tomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases, previous or concurrent ma-\nlignancy other than pancreatic cancer, uncontrolled ascites, or other\nclinically signiﬁcant co-morbidities.\nRandomization and treatment\nEligible patients were randomly assigned to both gem and nimo or togem and placebo, double-blinded in a one-to-one ratio. Randomization\nwas carried out centrally ensuring equal distribution of patients on the\nbasis of measurable lesions (locally advanced only versus metastatic dis-\nease). Brieﬂy, patients received gem 1000 mg/m\n2(i.v., 30-min infusion)\nonce weekly for 3 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest; and either additionalnimo 400 mg ﬁxed dose weekly or placebo, both administered i.v. as a 30-\nmin infusion. Treatment was continued until death, progressive disease,\nunacceptable toxicity, patient’s refusal or investigator’s decision. Physical\nexaminations, hematologic and biochemical tests were carried out at\nweekly intervals in both treatment groups. All adverse events were moni-tored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology\nCriteria (NCI-CTC) for Adverse Events (version 3.0). Treatment re-\nsponses (according to RECIST version 1.0) were assessed by CT/MRI inweek 8, 16, 24 and thereafter every 8 weeks until disease progression.\nQuality of life (QoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 at baseline\nand 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 weeks thereafter.\nThe primary end point was OS, secondary end points were PFS, overall\nresponse rate (ORR), duration of response (DR) and QoL, pain measure-\nment (pain intensity, analgesic consumption) and safety (adverse events,\nclinical laboratory assessments).\nStatistical analyses\nThe population for all analyses was deﬁned based on the full-analysis (FAS)\npopulation that was deﬁned as all patients, excluding patients who withdrewinformed consent before any study sp eciﬁc treatment started, or patients\nabout whom it became known a maximum of 4 weeks after randomization\nthat major in/exclusion criteria were violated. Brieﬂy, the primary end pointOS was assessed in a conﬁrmatory stati stical analysis based on a two-sided\nstatistical hypothesis test, determined from the date of randomization until\ndeath or last date of follow-up [ 17]. A two-sided log-rank test for equality of\nsurvival curves was used at a 5% signiﬁcance level. Additionally, a one-sided\nlog-rank test at a signiﬁcance level of 5% for superiority was carried out assecondary analysis. The secondary end point time to tumor progression\n(TTP) was measured from the date of randomization to the occurrence\nof progression or death or to the last date of observation without progres-\nsion or to death when relation to progression could be excluded. According\nto this deﬁnition, TTP corresponded to PFS commonly used forOriginal articleAnnals of Oncology\n2430 | Schultheis et al.

PFS and OS were descr ibed using the Kaplan–Meier method.\nCorrespondingly, 95% conﬁdence intervals were calculated for the median\nand speciﬁed survival rates (6 and 12 months). Further evaluation was car-ried out using Cox’s regression model. All other analyses were carried out\nwith an explorative aim. An increase in OS by 3 months or an increase in\nPFS by 2 months was to be considered as clinically relevant.\nResults\nPatients\nA total of 192 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pan-\ncreatic cancer were enrolled from 16 study centers in Germany,Turkey, and Switzerland and randomly assigned to either gemplus nimo ( n¼96 patients) or to gem plus placebo ( n¼96 pa-\ntients) (see Figure 1, CONSORT diagram). Demographic and\nclinical characteristics at baseline as well as KRAS status and\nEGFR-expression are shown in Table 1.\nStudy treatment\nThe median duration of treatment was 4 cycles (range 1–21) in\nthe nimo plus gem group, each lasting 28 days, and 3 cycles(range 1–22) in the gem plus placebo group. (The main reasonfor treatment discontinuation was disease progression.)\nObservation time\nThe observation time of 1 year was chosen in order to deﬁne iden-tical conditions of analysis for all patients, especially in order toavoid interactions through second-line treatments, which 71% ofall study patients received. Furthermore, 72% of the patients diedduring the ﬁrst year; 63% in the gem plus nimo group and 80% in\nthe gem plus placebo group.

In addition, the OS rate after 12 months was signiﬁ-\ncantly higher with gem plus nimo compared with gem plus placebo(34% versus 19%, P¼0.03).

The rate of PFS at 1-year was 22%\nin the gem plus nimo group, when compared with 10% in the\ngem plus placebo group (Figure 3).\nResponse rates\nThe objective response rates were not different among the treatment\ngroups (partial response rate 8.6% for each group). However, therate of disease control (conﬁrmed response or stable disease for/C2116 weeks) was 63% in the gemcitabine þnimotuzumab group\nand 52% in the gemcitabine þplacebo group (Table 2).\nSubgroup analyses\nLocally advanced versus metastatic patients. Patients with locally\nadvanced disease usually have a better prognosis compared withpatients showing metastatic disease. We therefore analyzed themseparately. No difference was seen in OS and PFS rates betweenthe two treatment arms for patients with locally advanced disease\nonly. Metastatic patients treated with gem plus nimo had a\n12-mo survival beneﬁt (26.1% versus 14.5% with gem plus pla-cebo) ( P¼0.04). Similar results were obtained for PFS rates\n(P¼0.02) (Table 2).Molecular biomarkers. Tissue sample of 97 patients were avail-\nable. A total of 49 patients in the gem plus nimo group and 48 pa-tients in the gem plus placebo group underwent molecular\nanalyses by real-time PCR (LightCycler\nVR) for KRAS mutations\nand EGFR-expression. Patients with KRAS wildtype had an OS\nbeneﬁt at 12 months ( P¼0.026) in the gem plus þnimo group\ncompared with the gem plus placebo group, whereas results forEGFR-overexpression just reach statistical signiﬁcance (Table 2).\nAdverse events and QoL\nCommon adverse events across both treatment groups were gen-\nerally grade 1–2. Hematologic adverse events were very similarfor both groups, with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia grade\nbeing slightly more frequent in the experimental arm (see supple\nmentary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). Here,\nthe most frequent non-hematologic adverse events were fatigue(21.5% of patients, one patient grade 3), pyrexia (in 16.1%), chills(in 11.8%) and rash (in 15.1%, two patients grade 3). In addition,the proportion of patients with at least one serious adverse event\nwas comparable across the two treatment groups (58.1% for gem\nplus nimo versus 65.6% for gem plus placebo). Quality-of-life as-sessments did not show statistically signiﬁcant differences in bothtreatment arms (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nThis randomized study showed that in the entire study popula-tion, gem combined with nimo is safe and well tolerated with asigniﬁcantly improved overall and PFS at 12 months. Even at18 months, OS rates are still superior for the combination treat-ment, but did not reach statistical signiﬁcance anymore. This is\nmost likely due to the high number of events during the ﬁrst\n12 months. Moreover, survival beneﬁt beyond 12 months wasprobably confounded by second-line therapies (more than 40%per arm), as patients were allowed to switch over to any further100 Percent surviving95\n90858075\n7065\n6055504540353025201510\n5\n0\n0123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2\nSurvival time (months)Experimental\nControl\nFigure 2.

Because no standard\nsecond-line therapy was deﬁned in pancreatic cancer patients, wedid not perform further analysis on this issue. In our study, me-dian OS was improved by 2.6 months in the gem þnimo group,\nwith gem monotherapy being the standard treatment at the time\nof study initiation and being still an option for patients in\nreduced overall condition or suffering from co-morbidities.Within the protocol, we considered a 2-month increase in PFS asclinically signiﬁcant, which was just missed, while a 3.6-monthincrease in OS can be considered as clinically relevant. However,the published median OS for pancreatic cancer treated with gem\n(6–7 months) in two large phase III trials ﬁts well with what we\ncould conﬁrm in our patient cohort. At the time of study design,neither nab-paclitaxel nor FOLFIRINOX were standards of ther-apy yet. A large, randomized phase III study of nab-paclitaxelplus gem versus gem led to a median improvement in OS of1.8 months [ 8]. The phase 2–3 trial of FOLFIRINOX versus gem\nalso showed an improvement in median survival by 4.3 months[7]. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher in 46% of FOLFIRINOX-\ntreated patients suggest that this regimen is an option only for pa-tients with a good performance status [ 7].\nIn contrast, the safety proﬁle for the gem plus nimo combin-\nation was favorable and comparable with the placebo arm. Chills,\nfatigue und pyrexia were slightly more frequent for the gem plus\nnimo group. Nimotuzumab was not associated with additionalhematologic adverse events and only 15% of the patients experi-enced skin toxicity, mostly grade 1–2. Patients with signiﬁcant co-morbidities are usually not candidates for more toxic regimens likethose mentioned above. Molecular targeted drugs have been exten-\nsively evaluated in pancreatic cancer, but the EGFR inhibitor erlo-\ntinib was the only compound showing a minor increase in survivalwhen combined with gem [ 9]. Cetuximab, another anti-EGFR\nmonoclonal antibody, failed to improve survival in a randomizedtrial, however, without stratiﬁcation to KRAS status [ 11].\nThe reported frequency of KRAS -WT in pancreatic cancer is\n/C2410%–30%, and in our study the percentage is considerableTable 2.

It is well documented, thatanti-EGFR-Abs failed in tumors with KRAS -mutations.\nTherefore, as expected, OS rates of patients with KRAS wildtype\nin the nimotuzumab group were signiﬁcantly better comparedwith patients with KRAS mutations, consistent with cetuximab\nstudies in colorectal cancer [ 19]. A phase II adjuvant trial in pan-\ncreatic cancer trial recently had shown a trend toward better sur-vival in cetuximab-treated KRAS wildtype patients [ 20]. We\ntherefore suggest antibody-based anti-EGFR-strategies in prese-\nlected RAS-WT pancreatic cancer patients for future clinical trials.\nMany agents that have shown promising results in phase II tri-\nals in pancreatic cancer eventually failed in phase III trials.Therefore, a limitation of this study is that the total number ofpatients is not powered for a regular phase III study.Nevertheless, this randomized study showed a signiﬁcant im-\nprovement in PFS and OS using gem in combination with nimo.\nA randomized phase III trial is planned to evaluate its beneﬁt inKRAS wildtype patients, with extended biomarker analysis to in-\nvestigate the molecular biology in this patient cohort.\nFunding\nThis multi-institutional, randomized phase IIb trial was spon-sored by Oncoscience AG, Wedel (recently Schenefeld),Germany.

Therefore, we conducted a phase III clinical study to verify\nthe efﬁcacy and safety of this combination regimen in patients with K-Ras wild-\ntype tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov identi ﬁer:NCT02395016 ).\nPATIENTS AND\nMETHODSEligible patients were randomly assigned to receive nimotuzumab (400 mg\nonce per week) or placebo followed by gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2on days 1, 8,\nand 15, once every 4 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nThe primary end point was overall survival (OS) and the secondary end pointswere progression-free survival (PFS), response rates, and safety.\nRESULTS A total of 480 patients were screened; 92 patients were enrolled and 82 patients\nwith K-Ras wild-type tumors were eligible. In the full analysis set, the median\nOS was 10.9 versus 8.5 months, while the restricted mean survival time (RMST)was 18.05 versus 11.14 months for the investigational versus control arm (ratioof control vinvestigation 50.62 [0.40-0.97]; P5.036). Median PFS was 4.2\nversus 3.6 months in the investigational versus control arm (log-rank P5.04;\nhazard ratio, 0.60 [0.37-0.99]) and the restricted mean PFS time was 8.08versus 4.76 months (RMST ratio, 0.58 [0.38-0.90]; P5.036). Both OS and PFS\nwere longer in the nimotuzumab group than in the placebo group. The objective\nresponse rates and disease control rates were 7% versus 10% and 68% versus\n63% for the investigational and control groups, respectively. The incidence ofadverse events were comparable between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION In patients with locally advanced or metastatic K-Ras wild-type PC, nimotu-\nzumab plus gemcitabine signi ﬁcantly improved OS and PFS with a good safety\nproﬁle.\nINTRODUCTION\nPancreatic cancer (PC) is a common and fatal malignancy\nthat occurs worldwide. Eighty percent of PC cases are di-\nagnosed as advanced or metastatic stage.1Twenty- ﬁve\npercent of patients with advanced PC are at a locally ad-vanced stage, with a median overall survival (mOS) of6-9 months. Approximately 60%-70% of patients withadvanced PC are at the metastatic stage, with mOS of only3-5 months.\n2–9Unfortunately, the current regimens are\nunsatisfactory. Encouraging the achievement of new reg-imens has been developed in many other cancer ﬁelds but\nrarely in PC. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective\ntherapies to prolong the survival of patients with PC.Nimotuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal\nantibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR). A phase IIb study (PCS07) done in Germany showedthat nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine might signi ﬁcantly\nimprove the mOS (8.6 months v6.0 months) of locally ad-\nvanced or metastatic PC, especially for the wild-type K-Rasgene subgroup (11.62 months v5.67 months; 1-year survival\nrates, 53.8% v15.8%, respectively).\n10In 2014, gemcitabine was\nwidely used and was considered the standard of care for ﬁrst-\nline treatment regimen for patients with advanced PC inChina. Thus, we conducted a phase III trial (NOTABLE study)to verify the ef ﬁcacy and safety of nimotuzumab plus gem-\ncitabine as ﬁrst-line treatment for patients with locally ad-\nvanced or metastatic PC.ACCOMPANYING CONTENT\nProtocol\nAccepted July 20, 2023\nPublished August 30, 2023\nJ Clin Oncol 00:1-11\n© 2023 by American Society ofClinical Oncology\nView Online\nArticle\nCreative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial No Derivatives\n4.0 License\nascopubs.org/journal/jco | Volume nnn, Issue nnn |1\nDownloaded from ascopubs.org by 66.96.253.194 on September 18, 2023 from 066.096.253.194\nCopyright © 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

The clinical bene ﬁt\nresponse (CBR) was evaluated every 8 weeks on the basis of theBurris criteria.\n13Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse\nevents were monitored by the investigators from the beginningof the treatment and up to 30 days after treatment completion.\nThe detected events were graded according to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03,\n14and\ncoded and summarized according to the preferred terms in theMedical Dictionary for Regulato ry Activities, version 24.0.\nStudy End Points\nThe primary end point was overall survival (OS), de ﬁned as\nthe time from random assignment to death due to anycause. Subgroup analyses of OS were based on prespeci ﬁed\nstratiﬁcation factors. The secondary end points were\nprogression-free survival (PFS), de ﬁned as the time from\nrandom assignment until objective tumor progression ordeath; time to progression (TTP, de ﬁned as the time from\nrandom assignment until objective tumor progression);objective response rate (ORR), including complete responseCONTEXT\nKey Objective\nDoes nimotuzumab (a humanized epithelial growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody) plus gemcitabine regimen provide\nan overall survival (OS) bene ﬁt for patients with locally advanced or metastatic K-Ras wild-type pancreatic cancer (PC)?\nKnowledge Generated\nIn a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, phase III clinical trial in China, patients with locally advanced or metastaticK-Ras wild-type PC were enrolled.

Treatment-related ad-\nverse events (TRAEs) were de ﬁned as adverse drug reac-\ntions (ADRs).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe primary end point was evaluated in the full analysis set(FAS; all eligible patients who received at least one dose ofnimotuzumab and had one evaluation of ef ﬁcacy). Secondary\nend points were analyzed only in the FAS. A prespeci ﬁed\nsubgroup analysis of OS and PFS was performed using theFAS. Safety analysis was performed using the safety analysisset (SS; patients received at least one antibody dose).\nStatistical analyses were performed using the SAS version\n9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). OS was the primary ef ﬁcacy\nend point and was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier\nmethod and strati ﬁed log-rank test. If the proportional\nhazards assumption was unsatisfactory (eg, survival curvecrossover), the restricted mean survival time (RMST)model\n15was used to analyze the survival bene ﬁt differ-\nence. RMST is suggested as a novel alternative measure insurvival analyses and may be us eful when the proportional\nhazards assumption cannot be made. A right-censored\np a t t e r nw a su s e df o rt h eO Sd a t a .T h et i m ep o i n to ft h e\nRMST model was the closest to the end of the trial.\nWe calculated that, with a sample of 276 patients, the study\nwould have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) fordeath with nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine (investigationalarm, or nimotuzumab-gemcitabine) versus placebo plusgemcitabine (control arm, or placebo-gemcitabine) of 0.69.\nThis estimation was based on the results of the full pop-\nulation in the PCS07 study, where the median OS of thegemcitabine monotherapy group was 6 months and themedian OS of the investigational arm was 8.7 months. Sincepatients with K-Ras wild-type PC were rare and recruitmentwas dif ﬁcult, we calculated that with a sample of 79 patients\nand 64 events, the study would have 80% power to detecta HR for death with nimotuzumab-gemcitabine versus\nplacebo-gemcitabine. This assumption was made on the\nbasis of the result of patients with K-Ras wild-type PC inPCS07 study, where the median OS of gemcitabine mono-therapy group was 5.67 months, and the median survival ofthe investigational group was 11.62 months. The sample sizere-estimation was approved by the Chinese regulatory au-thorities. At the time of approval, 92 patients were enrolledand the study was terminated.\nMultivariate analysis of survival data was conducted using\nthe Cox proportional hazard model according to prespeci ﬁed\nstratiﬁcation factors to evaluate the treatment effect. In\naddition to the HR as a measurement of the relative risk of anevent, the RMST ratio between arms (control vinvestigation)\nwas estimated after adjusting for covariates. For this anal-\nysis, a ratio of <1 indicated survival improvement in theinvestigational arm. Unlike the HR, the RMST ratio does not\nrely on any model assumption.\n16\nThe ORR was analyzed using the Fisher test, while the DCRand CBR were evaluated using the chi-squared test. AEs wereclassiﬁed according to the system organ class, preferred\nterm, or severity grade.\nRESULTS\nPatients and Treatment Groups\nA total of 480 patients from 25 study sites in China werescreened between April 2015 and March 2021. Then, 92patients with the K-Ras wild-type gene were eligible for\nrandom assignment, and 90 patients were allocated for\ntreatment. Eight patients who did not have K-Ras wild-typetumors according to a gene con ﬁrmatory procedure (seven\ncases) or PC (one gallbladder carcinoma case), detectedduring monitoring, were excluded. Finally, 82 patients wereanalyzed as part of the FAS, and 41 were included in eachgroup. The FAS group was the modi ﬁed intent-to-treat\ngroup ( Fig 1 ).\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline\nwere well balanced between the two groups ( Table 1 ).\nEfﬁcacy\nOS\nThe OS analysis was based on 76 deaths, including 36 deaths\nin the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group and 40 deaths in theplacebo-gemcitabine group. The mean follow-up time was57.6 months and 16.6 months, respectively, for the two\ngroups. The data cutoff was January 27, 2022. The median OS\nwas 10.9 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 16.3) in the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group and 8.5 months (95% CI, 5.7 to 10.0) in theplacebo-gemcitabine group (Cox proportional HR, 0.66; 95%CI, 0.42 to 1.05; log-rank P5.08;Fig 2A ). When using RMST\nmodel, the RMST was 18.05 months (95% CI, 11.71 to 24.38) inthe nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group and 11.14 months (95%CI, 8.07 to 14.20) in the placebo-gemcitabine group (RMST\nratio of control vtreatment, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.97;\nP5.036; Table 2 ). OS was signi ﬁcantly longer in the\nnimotuzumab-gemcitabine group ( Fig 2C ).\nPFS and TTP\nPFS was signi ﬁcantly longer in the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine\ngroup than in the placebo-gemcitabine group, with mediansurvival time of 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.7 to 7.3) versus3.6 months (95% CI, 2.0 to 5.0; HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37 to0.99; log-rank P5.04), respectively ( Fig 2B ). At a follow-\nup of 31 months, the restricted mean PFS time was8.08 months (95% CI, 5.20 to 10.94) in the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group and 4.76 months (95% CI, 3.41 to 6.09)\nin the placebo-gemcitabine group (RMST ratio, 0.58;\nJournal of Clinical Oncology ascopubs.org/journal/jco | Volume nnn, Issue nnn |3Nimotuzumab Plus Gemcitabine for K-Ras Pancreatic Cancer\nDownloaded from ascopubs.org by 66.96.253.194 on September 18, 2023 from 066.096.253.194\nCopyright © 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

No grade 4-5 AEs were\nobserved in this trial.\nDISCUSSION\nThis prospective, randomized , controlled, double-blind,\nmulticenter clinical trial demonstrated that nimotuzumabcombined with gemcitabine prolonged the median OS time\nby 2.4 months and decreased the mortality risk by 34%compared with the placebo gr oup by Cox regression. Once\nthe trial was completed, we observed that the survivalcurves overlapped until 6 months and gradually separatedthereafter. In this situation , the proportional hazard as-\nsumption for the Cox regression model does not hold.\nConsequently, it is not a robust method. Subsequently, weused the RMST model to calculate the survival differencesbetween the two curves using the RMST ratio, which behavesas an analog of the Cox proportional HR. The mortality riskdecreased by 38%, which was equivalent to RMST ratio 0.62(0.40-0.97) calculated at the placebo-gemcitabine versusnimotuzumab-gemcitabine direction, and the differences\nwere statistically signi ﬁcant. The RMST for both OS and PFS\nwas signi ﬁcantly longer in the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine\ngroup than in the control group. The 1-year and 3-year OSrates were 43.6% versus 26.8% and 13.9% versus 2.7% inthe investigational and control arms, respectively.

In a previous study, the median OS of gemcitabine\nmonotherapy was 5.65 months.\n13However, the median OS\nwas increased to 6.24 months when combined with\nerlotinib,17and 8.5 months and 1-year OS rate of 35%\nwhen albumin-paclitaxel was added to gemcitabine.18In\naddition to these regimens, the ﬂuorouracil, leucovorin,\nirinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) schedulehad the longest median survival time of 11.1 months;its usage is limited owing to side effects.\n19Compared\nwith the current treatment alternatives, the medianOS of nimotuzumab-gemcit abine in this study was\n10.9 months, and the 1-year OS rate was 43.6%, which was\nequal to that of the FOLFIRINOX regimen, but with abetter safety pro ﬁle.PFS was also signi ﬁcantly higher in the nimotuzumab arm,\naccording to the log-rank Pvalue and RMST method. The\nORRs of the two treatment groups were similar; however, the\nDCR and CBR were higher in the nimotuzumab group, al-\nthough the difference was not statistically signi ﬁcant. These\nresults indicate that nimotuzumab may improve diseasecontrol and slow the progression of advanced PC.\nIn the subgroup analyses, the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine\ncombination showed a greater bene ﬁt, which was consis-\ntent with the results of the total population analysis. Thesubgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution be-cause after adjusting the sample size, the subgroups weresmall. Regarding the safety pro ﬁle, AEs or ADRs were\ncomparable between the two groups and did not increaseafter the addition of nimotuzumab. The frequency of total\nhematologic or nonhematologic AEs (including grade\n3 AEs) >10% was similar betwe en the two groups.

This trial con ﬁrmed that nimotuzumab has a good\nsafety pro ﬁle.\nThe proportion of K-Ras wild-type tumors in our study was\n17.1%. This percentage was higher than the internationallyreported data, but similar to a previous nationwide study in\nChina (16.8%).\n20\nOne limitation of this study is that EGFR expression and other\ngenetic mutation types were not evaluated. It is unknownwhether patients with activation of the mitogen-activated\nprotein kinase pathway because of BRAF mutations would\nbeneﬁt from nimotuzumab treatment. Alternatively, other\nkinase fusion genes might confer sensitivity to nimotuzumab.Delineating the molecular subtypes of K-Ras wild-type tu-\nmors could improve patient selection for nimotuzumab\ntreatment.\nInformation on subsequent treatments after disease pro-\ngression was not collected, whi ch is another limitation of\nthis study. Third, although there were no statistically\nsigniﬁcant differences in baseline c haracteristi cs between\nthe two arms, nimotuzumab-tre ated patients were slightly\nyounger and had a better performance status. These fea-\ntures may have led to the improved treatment compliance.\nFinally, the study protocol was formulated in 2014,\nwhen the standard of care of ﬁrst-line treatment regimens\nin China was gemcitabine monotherapy.

  "New Microsoft Word Document.docx": "### Project Overview: AI-Agentic Pharma Sales Platform\n\n\n\nBased on your description, I'll outline a phased approach to building an AI-agentic project for selling pharmaceutical products. The core idea is to start with a messaging-based product knowledge assistant (Phase 1) and evolve it into a data-driven, predictive smart sales platform (Phase 2). This leverages AI for interactive support, ensuring sales teams can access accurate product info on-the-fly while complying with pharma regulations (e.g., avoiding unsubstantiated claims or off-label promotion—always consult legal experts).\n\n\n\nI'll assume the pharma products are legal, over-the-counter or prescription items sold through ethical channels. The system will use a messaging platform for real-time Q&A, linked to a centralized product knowledge base (e.g., a database of drug info, dosages, side effects, and sales scripts).\n\n\n\n#### Key Assumptions and Considerations\n\n- **Target Users**: Sales reps interacting via messaging to query product details during customer engagements.\n\n- **Tech Stack**: Open-source or affordable tools to keep it scalable. Use LLMs like Grok (from xAI) for natural language processing.\n\n- **Compliance**: Pharma sales involve strict rules (e.g., FDA/EMA guidelines). The AI must cite sources from approved knowledge bases and log interactions for audits.\n\n- **Security**: Handle sensitive data (e.g., customer queries) with encryption; use HIPAA-compliant tools if dealing with health info.\n\n- **Platforms**: WhatsApp (via Business API for broad reach), Telegram (easy bot setup), or a dedicated app (e.g., built with Twilio or custom web app for full control).\n\n\n\n#### Phase 1: Messaging-Based Product Knowledge Assistant\n\nThis phase focuses on a simple, interactive AI agent that acts as a \"knowledge source\" for sales reps. They can ask questions about products they're selling, and the AI responds with linked info from a curated database.\n\n\n\n**Objectives**:\n\n- Enable quick Q&A for sales reps (e.g., \"What's the dosage for Product X?\").\n\n- Link responses to official product knowledge (e.g., PDFs, databases).\n\n- Prototype quickly for testing.\n\n\n\n**Implementation Steps**:\n\n1. **Choose and Set Up Messaging Platform**:\n\n   - **WhatsApp**: Use WhatsApp Business API. Integrate with a backend (e.g., via Meta's developer tools). Pros: High user adoption in many regions. Cons: Approval process for API access.\n\n   - **Telegram**: Build a bot using Telegram Bot API. Pros: Free, easy to deploy with Python libraries like `python-telegram-bot`. Cons: Less professional for B2B.\n\n   - **Dedicated**: Use Twilio or Dialogflow for a custom messaging interface. Pros: Full customization, integrate with CRM. Cons: Higher setup cost.\n\n   - Recommendation: Start with Telegram for rapid prototyping, then migrate to WhatsApp for scale.\n\n\n\n2. **Build the AI Agent**:\n\n   - **Core AI**: Use an LLM (e.g., Grok API) to process natural language queries. Feed it a product knowledge base (e.g., a vector database like Pinecone or FAISS storing pharma docs).\n\n   - **Knowledge Base**: Create a structured database:\n\n     - Sources: Product inserts, clinical studies, sales guides (upload as PDFs or text).\n\n     - Tools: Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to fetch relevant info—e.g., query \"side effects of Aspirin\" retrieves exact matches.\n\n   - **Interaction Flow**:\n\n     - Sales rep messages: \"Tell me about Product Y's interactions.\"\n\n     - AI responds: \"Product Y interacts with [list].

Its incidence was high in the Asian population, especially in certain parts such as Southern China\nand South East Asia. Most patients with NPC are presented with intermediate-stage or locally advanced\ndisease requiring chemoradiation as the primary treatment of choice. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor\n(EGFR) was found overexpressed in most patients with NPC associated with poor prognosis making its\ninhibitor one of the most plausible treatment options in addition to chemoradiation. In EGFR-positive NPC\npatients, nimotuzumab, a humanized anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody will bind the extracellular domain of\nEGFR leading to tumor growth suppressions. This study’s objective was to assess the real-world clinical\nefficacy of nimotuzumab for patients with intermediate-stage and locally advanced NPC when in\ncombination with concurrent chemoradiation.\nMethods: This retrospective real-world study examined a sample of intermediate-stage and locally advanced\nNPC patients who were treated with or without adding nimotuzumab to concurrent chemoradiation at Dr.\nCipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital in Indonesia from January 2009 to December 2017. The outcomes\nwere patients’ real-world five-year overall survival (rwOS) and progression-free survival (rwPFS) compared\nusing Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities,\nclinical staging, staging based on Tumor status (T), staging based on Nodes status (N), and types of\nradiotherapy. \nResults: A total of 407 patients were included in the analysis, 61 patients receiving concurrent nimotuzumab\nand chemoradiation and 346 patients receiving chemoradiation alone. Patients receiving concurrent\nnimotuzumab and chemoradiation tended to have less aggressive NPC than patients receiving\nchemoradiation alone. Multivariate-adjusted Cox models revealed that combining nimotuzumab with\nchemoradiation was associated with a statistically significant longer rwOS gain (hazard ratio (HR)=0.46 (95%\nCI: 0.26-0.82, p=0.008)) and a trend of longer rwPFS (hazard ratio (HR)=0.67 (95% CI: 0.41-1.09, p=0.109)) in\ncomparison to chemoradiation alone. \nConclusion: In this retrospective real-world study, concurrent nimotuzumab and chemoradiation usage was\nassociated with a significant overall survival benefit than chemoradiation alone for intermediate-stage and\nlocally advanced NPC patients. Hence, adding nimotuzumab to patients’ chemoradiation should be\nconsidered in patients with intermediate-stage and locally advanced NPC.\nCategories:\n Internal Medicine, Otolaryngology, Radiation Oncology\nKeywords:\n survival, prognosis, chemoradiation, anti-egfr, egfr, nimotuzumab, nasopharyngeal carcinoma\nIntroduction\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma is one of the most common types of cancer in the head and neck region, with a\nunique geographical distribution \n[1]\n. It is most prevalent in the Asian population. Indonesia has become the\nsecond country with the highest incidence after China, with an incidence rate of 5,7 per 100.000 cases in\nmen and 1,9 per 100.000 cases in women. This number is much higher than the global incidence rate given\nthat the cancer cases in Indonesia are not well-documented, indicating a possible higher number in reality\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5,\n6\n \nOpen Access Original\nArticle\n \nDOI:\n 10.7759/cureus.48804\nHow to cite this article\nRachman A, Sari S, Munandar A, et al. (November 14, 2023) Combining Nimotuzumab With Chemotherapy for Patients With Locally Advanced\nand Intermediate-Stage Nasopharyngeal Cancer: A Retrospective Comparison Study Using Five-Year, Real-World Survival Data. Cureus 15(11):\ne48804. \nDOI 10.7759/cureus.48804\n[2]\n.\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma is stratified into several stages according to the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM)\nclassification system. The treatment approach was based on what stages patients presented when admitted.\nCurrently, there are various treatment modalities for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, such as radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, targeted therapy, or surgery, with the former being more commonly used than the latter \n[3]\n.\nEven though nasopharyngeal carcinoma is radiosensitive, most patients who presented with locally\nadvanced disease required additional chemotherapy in their treatment regimens \n[4-6]\n. The combination of\nradiotherapy and chemotherapy has improved the overall survival in patients with nasopharyngeal\ncarcinoma. However, about 25% of patients were facing a treatment failure, thus an alternate treatment\nmodality has to be considered in addition to chemoradiation \n[7]\n. This is becoming more important\nconsidering the adverse events that patients experience after chemoradiation \n[8]\n. One to be acknowledged is\na targeted therapy in which an antibody acts toward a specific protein involved in tumorigenesis. Examples\nof targeted therapy are antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor (VEGF) \n[9]\n.\nThe overexpression of EGFR in nasopharyngeal tumor cells enables its function as a treatment modality a\nlegitimate option for patients with intermediate-stage and locally advanced disease \n[9]\n. Nimotuzumab, as\none of the monoclonal antibodies against EGFR, has been found to have an effect on reducing tumor\nvolumes despite its role in increasing overall survival in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal\ncarcinoma (NPC) while in combination with other treatment regimens is still debatable. Previously, a phase\nIII randomized clinical trial by Kong et al., involving 135 NPC patients, revealed that concurrent\nnimotuzumab with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) following TPF-based induction\nchemotherapy in comparison with concurrent chemoradiation with Cisplatin had a similar effect with lower\ntoxicities \n[10]\n. Hence, this observational study was conducted to evaluate the real-world data of adding\nnimotuzumab to other treatment regimens and its effect on patients with intermediate-stage and locally\nadvanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma in clinical practice.\nThis article’s abstract will be presented as a poster display at ESMO Asia Congress 2023 on December 1-3,\n2023.\nMaterials And Methods\nData source\nThis study was approved by the Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia’s ethical committee with\napproval number KET-456/UN2.F1/ETIK/PPM.00.02/2023. The data used in this study were obtained from\nelectronic and printed medical records at the Department of Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT), the Department of\nRadiation Oncology, and the Department of Internal Medicine, Dr. Cipto Manungkusumo General Hospital.\nData regarding patients’ status not documented in the medical record was extracted from the civil registry.\nPatient selection\nA total of 439 patients admitted with nasopharyngeal carcinoma from January 2009 to December 2017 were\nevaluated retrospectively. The inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma\nfrom all age groups who were either receiving nimotuzumab or chemoradiation. Patients with stage I\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma, metastatic disease, and patients with unknown staging were excluded from the\nstudy. Data extraction was conducted from March 9, 2023, to March 31, 2023. From the data collected, 84 out\nof 439 patients were receiving nimotuzumab. The remaining 355 patients were treated with chemoradiation,\nwhich was the control of this study. All the data taken were then tabulated in a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft\nCorporation, Redmond, WA) table.\nStudy endpoint\nThe primary outcome assessed in this study was five-year real-world overall survival (rwOS) in patients\nreceiving nimotuzumab or control. Another outcome, such as five-year real-world progression-free survival\n(rwPFS) was assessed. Five-year rwOS was defined as patients’ survival from any cause of death in five years\nafter the initiation of patients’ therapy. Meanwhile, five-year rwPFS was defined as patients’ survival from\ntheir disease progression which includes tumor growth and spread. Patients’ progression was determined\nfrom the follow-up radiological examination results taken from patients' medical records. The start index\ndate was the first day that patients received treatment: either nimotuzumab or chemotherapy. Patients\nwithout recorded death or loss of follow-up were censored.\nData analysis\nThis study performed the analysis using SPSS version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The primary outcome of\nthis study was presented as Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the Cox proportional hazard analysis. Other\nvariables regarding baseline characteristics between the two groups were evaluated using crosstabs,\nfollowed by chi-square tests for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank sums test for continuous\nvariables. The effect of different treatment care for patients on rwOS and rwPFS was tested using the\n2023 Rachman et al. Cureus 15(11): e48804. DOI 10.7759/cureus.48804\n2\n of \n10\nmultivariate analysis with adjustment for gender, age, comorbidities, clinical staging, staging based on\nTumor status (T), staging based on Nodes status (N), and types of radiotherapy.\nResults\nPatients’ socio-demography\nAmong the 439 screened patients, 2 patients were receiving nimotuzumab with a diagnosis of stage I\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma and 2 patients had metastatic disease; thus they were excluded. A total of 11\npatients, 9 patients receiving nimotuzumab and 2 receiving control, were also excluded due to unknown\nstaging based on their medical records. Patients with unknown records of radiotherapy modalities were\nexcluded, 10 patients from the nimotuzumab receiving group and 7 patients from the control group.\nTherefore, the remaining 407 patients were eligible for further analysis. \nThe radiotherapy (RT) regimens recorded were 2-dimensional RT, 3-dimensional conformal RT, and\nintensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The RT doses were equivalent to 70 Gy for gross tumor and\nnodes, 60 Gy for high-risk areas, and 50 Gy for elective nodes. The chemotherapy regimens included were\ncisplatin, 5FU, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and capecitabine. The dose of nimotuzumab in the interventional\ngroup was 200 mg weekly.\nIn this study, it was revealed that the proportion of sex distribution was equal in both the nimotuzumab-\nreceiving group and the control group (p = 0.162). The age of patients was also similar in both groups (p =\n0.276). Even though both groups, the majority of patients were classified as WHO type 3 by histopathologic\nfindings, with 73.8% in patients receiving nimotuzumab and 87.6% in patients receiving the control, the\ndistribution was significantly uneven (p = 0.00).\nIn both groups, most patients were diagnosed in the late stage (clinical stage IVA) even though the\ndifference was enormous (45.9% vs 81.8%, p = 0.00). Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes\nmellitus, renal disease, and liver disease were found more in patients who didn’t receive nimotuzumab\n(44.2% vs 14.1%, p = 0.00). Adjusted comparisons between a combination with nimotuzumab and\nchemoradiation alone were conducted using multivariate Cox models, controlling for patient baseline\ncharacteristics, including age, gender, comorbidities, clinical staging, staging based on Tumor status (T),\nstaging based on Node status (N), and types of radiotherapy.

The mean\nsurvival in all of the patients was estimated as 8.4 years. The mean survival time in patients receiving\nnimotuzumab was estimated as 11.12 (95% CI: 9.731-12.509) years while the other group was estimated as\n6.23 (95% CI: 5.748-6.716) years.\nFIGURE\n 1: Kaplan-Meier survival curves for five-year rwOS\nrwOS: real-world overall survival\nPatients’ rwPFS was also analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Figure \n2\n).

The unadjusted result was significantly different (p = 0.02). The mean\nprogression-free survival in the nimotuzumab-receiving group was 9.181 (95% CI: 7.612-10.750) years while\nin control was 5.425 (95% CI: 4.946-5.904) years.\n2023 Rachman et al.

Previous studies have shown that nimotuzumab improved patients’ overall\n2023 Rachman et al. Cureus 15(11): e48804. DOI 10.7759/cureus.48804\n7\n of \n10\nremission rate and overall survival when in combination with chemoradiation. A meta-analysis conducted\nby Yuan et al. revealed that a combination of nimotuzumab and RT/chemoradiation had a better overall\nremission rate (ORR) of the primary tumor than a combination of cetuximab with RT/chemoradiation (ORR =\n3.21 (95% CI: 1.97-5.21)) or RT/chemoradiation alone (ORR = 4.11 (95% CI: 2.43-6.94)). Their results also\nshowed that nimotuzumab had a trend of longer three-year OS than a combination of cetuximab with\nRT/chemoradiation (OS rate = 4.22 (95% CI: 1.61-11.05)) or RT/chemoradiation alone (OS rate = 2.05 (95% CI:\n0.62-6.76)) \n[11]\n. A study by Liu et al. evaluating nimotuzumab's efficacy in combination with chemoradiation\nin 42 NPC patients reported that the ORR was 100% and the two-year OS was 96.6% \n[12]\n. Another study\nconducted by Fangzheng et al. revealed a satisfactory result with a three-year OS of 86.8% \n[13]\n. Whilst the\nORR was not analyzed, our study affirmed that patients receiving nimotuzumab in their chemoradiation had\nbetter OS than patients receiving chemoradiation alone gained (hazard ratio (HR)=0.46 (95% CI: 0.26-0.82,\np=0.008)). In comparison with the study by Liu et al. and Wang et al., we reported lower OS (73.8%) but with\na longer period of follow-up time and a larger amount of patients. Consistent results of better OS in patients\nreceiving nimotuzumab were hypothetically related to its mechanism in which nimotuzumab will enhance\nCisplatin's effect by involving the EGFR/AKT activation. Thus, adding nimotuzumab to chemoradiation\ncould benefit patients with NPC by increasing the apoptotic effect of chemotherapy \n[14]\n.\nIn spite of a better five-year rwOS in patients receiving nimotuzumab, the five-year rwPFS was not\nsignificantly different even though the trend was better in the nimotuzumab-receiving group (HR=0.67 (95%\nCI: 0.41-1.09, p=0.109)). Regardless of the non-significant rwPFS, our result showed that adding\nnimotuzumab to patients' chemoradiation improved patients' rwPFS by 18.5%. Our study was in accordance\nwith a larger propensity score-matched analysis by Zhi-Qiang et al., which revealed a slightly better five-\nyear PFS in the nimotuzumab receiving group (79.96% vs 77.99%, p=0.117) involving 730 patients with NPC\n[15]\n. A phase II clinical trial by Huang et al. reported a better PFS of 83.5% \n[16]\n. Another propensity score-\nmatched analysis conducted by Yao et al. showed that the five-year PFS was significantly better in patients\nreceiving nimotuzumab than patients receiving chemoradiation alone even after adjustment (aHR=0.38 (95%\nCI, 0.11-0.89, p=0.041)) \n[17]\n. In comparison with the study by Huang et al. and the study by Yao et al., our\nstudy involved a larger amount of patients and a longer period of follow-up time. An essential point to take\nnote of was that the disease progression was evaluated with a radiological examination, either a follow-up\nCT scan or MRI after a month, two months, and three months while the gold standard was a follow-up\nnasopharyngeal MRI test after 12 weeks. With various modalities in evaluating patients' progression, the\nfive-year rwPFS should be interpreted carefully.\nAside from its benefit for patients' survival, our study revealed that patients receiving nimotuzumab had\nfewer toxicities. Some of the minimal adverse reactions reported were mucositis,\nhyperpigmentation, xerostomia, and nausea experienced by 32.8% of patients receiving nimotuzumab and\nwere considered tolerable. This result was consistent with a study by Chen et al. who used cetuximab and\nnimotuzumab in combination with radiotherapy for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients\nshowed that patients receiving cetuximab in their care had a higher incidence of mucositis than patients\ntreated with nimotuzumab (87% vs 15%) \n[18]\n. The mechanism was postulated in a study by Takeda et al.,\nstating that nimotuzumab had a different binding manner than other antibodies against EGFR. Dissimilar to\ncetuximab, which binds to cells with lower EGFR expression levels in a monovalent manner, nimotuzumab\nrequires a divalent binding \n[19]\n. As a consequence, in cells with lower EGFR expression levels, such as skin,\nnimotuzumab will cause fewer adverse reactions.\nMost of the proposed confounding factors, such as gender, clinical stage, staging based on Tumor status (T),\ncomorbidities, and types of radiotherapy, had no significant effect on the five-year rwOS and rwPFS.\nMeanwhile, the result showed that older age slightly affected patients' five-year rwOS (aHR=1.015 (95% CI:\n1.002-1.028, p=0.02)) and a non-significant effect in five-year rwPFS (aHR=1.008 (95% CI: 0.996-1.020,\np=0.197)). Similarly, staging based on Nodes status (N), especially patients with N3, affected patients' five-\nyear rwOS significantly (aHR=2.414 (95% CI: 1.241-4.699, p=0.009)) and a trend of worse rwPFS (aHR=1.473\n(95% CI: 0.841-2.580, p=0.175). We omitted histological results based on WHO types from the Cox\nproportional hazard model due to its unrecorded data in some patients (N/A category). According to a study\nby Siti-Azrin et al., the WHO classification type did not significantly affect patients' prognosis \n[20]\n.\nTherefore, excluding the aforementioned variable should not interfere with our results.\nLimitation\nThis study was conducted retrospectively, which could lead to sample size and selection bias. Being\nretrospective, it is inherently limited by the accuracy of historical medical records and potential confounders\nnot accounted for in the analysis. Another essential fact concerning the unequal number of patients between\nthe two groups should be taken into consideration while interpreting our results. In our study, data\nregarding patients' EBV DNA levels, which can affect patients' prognosis, was not evaluated. Lastly, this\nstudy did not compare nimotuzumab with other EGFR inhibitors directly, which could have provided clearer\npictures of its relative efficacy.\nConclusions\nIn summary, despite the above-mentioned limitations, this study provides a reference value in regard to\n2023 Rachman et al. Cureus 15(11): e48804. DOI 10.7759/cureus.48804\n8\n of \n10\nnimotuzumab utilization for patients with intermediate-stage and locally advanced NPC. In this\nretrospective, real-world study of intermediate-stage and locally advanced NPC patients, concurrent\nnimotuzumab and chemoradiation usage was associated with a significant overall survival benefit than\nchemoradiation alone. Hence, the combination of nimotuzumab and chemoradiation should be considered\nin patients with intermediate-stage and locally advanced NPC.\nWe recommend the conduction of larger, prospective, multi-center trials with balanced patients between the\ninterventional and control groups in the future.\nAdditional Information\nAuthor Contributions\nAll authors have reviewed the final version to be published and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the\nwork.\nConcept and design:\n  \nAndhika Rachman, Arie Munandar, Marlinda Adham, Susanna H.

Therefore, we conducted a phase III clinical study to verify\nthe efﬁcacy and safety of this combination regimen in patients with K-Ras wild-\ntype tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov identi ﬁer:NCT02395016 ).\nPATIENTS AND\nMETHODSEligible patients were randomly assigned to receive nimotuzumab (400 mg\nonce per week) or placebo followed by gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2on days 1, 8,\nand 15, once every 4 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nThe primary end point was overall survival (OS) and the secondary end pointswere progression-free survival (PFS), response rates, and safety.\nRESULTS A total of 480 patients were screened; 92 patients were enrolled and 82 patients\nwith K-Ras wild-type tumors were eligible. In the full analysis set, the median\nOS was 10.9 versus 8.5 months, while the restricted mean survival time (RMST)was 18.05 versus 11.14 months for the investigational versus control arm (ratioof control vinvestigation 50.62 [0.40-0.97]; P5.036). Median PFS was 4.2\nversus 3.6 months in the investigational versus control arm (log-rank P5.04;\nhazard ratio, 0.60 [0.37-0.99]) and the restricted mean PFS time was 8.08versus 4.76 months (RMST ratio, 0.58 [0.38-0.90]; P5.036). Both OS and PFS\nwere longer in the nimotuzumab group than in the placebo group. The objective\nresponse rates and disease control rates were 7% versus 10% and 68% versus\n63% for the investigational and control groups, respectively. The incidence ofadverse events were comparable between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION In patients with locally advanced or metastatic K-Ras wild-type PC, nimotu-\nzumab plus gemcitabine signi ﬁcantly improved OS and PFS with a good safety\nproﬁle.\nINTRODUCTION\nPancreatic cancer (PC) is a common and fatal malignancy\nthat occurs worldwide. Eighty percent of PC cases are di-\nagnosed as advanced or metastatic stage.1Twenty- ﬁve\npercent of patients with advanced PC are at a locally ad-vanced stage, with a median overall survival (mOS) of6-9 months. Approximately 60%-70% of patients withadvanced PC are at the metastatic stage, with mOS of only3-5 months.\n2–9Unfortunately, the current regimens are\nunsatisfactory. Encouraging the achievement of new reg-imens has been developed in many other cancer ﬁelds but\nrarely in PC. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective\ntherapies to prolong the survival of patients with PC.Nimotuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal\nantibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR). A phase IIb study (PCS07) done in Germany showedthat nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine might signi ﬁcantly\nimprove the mOS (8.6 months v6.0 months) of locally ad-\nvanced or metastatic PC, especially for the wild-type K-Rasgene subgroup (11.62 months v5.67 months; 1-year survival\nrates, 53.8% v15.8%, respectively).\n10In 2014, gemcitabine was\nwidely used and was considered the standard of care for ﬁrst-\nline treatment regimen for patients with advanced PC inChina. Thus, we conducted a phase III trial (NOTABLE study)to verify the ef ﬁcacy and safety of nimotuzumab plus gem-\ncitabine as ﬁrst-line treatment for patients with locally ad-\nvanced or metastatic PC.ACCOMPANYING CONTENT\nProtocol\nAccepted July 20, 2023\nPublished August 30, 2023\nJ Clin Oncol 00:1-11\n© 2023 by American Society ofClinical Oncology\nView Online\nArticle\nCreative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial No Derivatives\n4.0 License\nascopubs.org/journal/jco | Volume nnn, Issue nnn |1\nDownloaded from ascopubs.org by 66.96.253.194 on September 18, 2023 from 066.096.253.194\nCopyright © 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

The principal investigators from each site adhered to\nthe study protocol. In addition, data were collected andanalyzed by professional third-party statisticians who cer-tiﬁed the accuracy and completeness of the reported data.\nPatents\nPatients with locally advanced or metastatic PC were\nscreened.

Treatment-related ad-\nverse events (TRAEs) were de ﬁned as adverse drug reac-\ntions (ADRs).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe primary end point was evaluated in the full analysis set(FAS; all eligible patients who received at least one dose ofnimotuzumab and had one evaluation of ef ﬁcacy). Secondary\nend points were analyzed only in the FAS. A prespeci ﬁed\nsubgroup analysis of OS and PFS was performed using theFAS. Safety analysis was performed using the safety analysisset (SS; patients received at least one antibody dose).\nStatistical analyses were performed using the SAS version\n9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). OS was the primary ef ﬁcacy\nend point and was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier\nmethod and strati ﬁed log-rank test. If the proportional\nhazards assumption was unsatisfactory (eg, survival curvecrossover), the restricted mean survival time (RMST)model\n15was used to analyze the survival bene ﬁt differ-\nence. RMST is suggested as a novel alternative measure insurvival analyses and may be us eful when the proportional\nhazards assumption cannot be made. A right-censored\np a t t e r nw a su s e df o rt h eO Sd a t a .T h et i m ep o i n to ft h e\nRMST model was the closest to the end of the trial.\nWe calculated that, with a sample of 276 patients, the study\nwould have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) fordeath with nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine (investigationalarm, or nimotuzumab-gemcitabine) versus placebo plusgemcitabine (control arm, or placebo-gemcitabine) of 0.69.\nThis estimation was based on the results of the full pop-\nulation in the PCS07 study, where the median OS of thegemcitabine monotherapy group was 6 months and themedian OS of the investigational arm was 8.7 months. Sincepatients with K-Ras wild-type PC were rare and recruitmentwas dif ﬁcult, we calculated that with a sample of 79 patients\nand 64 events, the study would have 80% power to detecta HR for death with nimotuzumab-gemcitabine versus\nplacebo-gemcitabine. This assumption was made on the\nbasis of the result of patients with K-Ras wild-type PC inPCS07 study, where the median OS of gemcitabine mono-therapy group was 5.67 months, and the median survival ofthe investigational group was 11.62 months. The sample sizere-estimation was approved by the Chinese regulatory au-thorities. At the time of approval, 92 patients were enrolledand the study was terminated.\nMultivariate analysis of survival data was conducted using\nthe Cox proportional hazard model according to prespeci ﬁed\nstratiﬁcation factors to evaluate the treatment effect. In\naddition to the HR as a measurement of the relative risk of anevent, the RMST ratio between arms (control vinvestigation)\nwas estimated after adjusting for covariates. For this anal-\nysis, a ratio of <1 indicated survival improvement in theinvestigational arm. Unlike the HR, the RMST ratio does not\nrely on any model assumption.\n16\nThe ORR was analyzed using the Fisher test, while the DCRand CBR were evaluated using the chi-squared test. AEs wereclassiﬁed according to the system organ class, preferred\nterm, or severity grade.\nRESULTS\nPatients and Treatment Groups\nA total of 480 patients from 25 study sites in China werescreened between April 2015 and March 2021. Then, 92patients with the K-Ras wild-type gene were eligible for\nrandom assignment, and 90 patients were allocated for\ntreatment. Eight patients who did not have K-Ras wild-typetumors according to a gene con ﬁrmatory procedure (seven\ncases) or PC (one gallbladder carcinoma case), detectedduring monitoring, were excluded. Finally, 82 patients wereanalyzed as part of the FAS, and 41 were included in eachgroup. The FAS group was the modi ﬁed intent-to-treat\ngroup ( Fig 1 ).\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline\nwere well balanced between the two groups ( Table 1 ).\nEfﬁcacy\nOS\nThe OS analysis was based on 76 deaths, including 36 deaths\nin the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group and 40 deaths in theplacebo-gemcitabine group. The mean follow-up time was57.6 months and 16.6 months, respectively, for the two\ngroups. The data cutoff was January 27, 2022.

No grade 4-5 AEs were\nobserved in this trial.\nDISCUSSION\nThis prospective, randomized , controlled, double-blind,\nmulticenter clinical trial demonstrated that nimotuzumabcombined with gemcitabine prolonged the median OS time\nby 2.4 months and decreased the mortality risk by 34%compared with the placebo gr oup by Cox regression. Once\nthe trial was completed, we observed that the survivalcurves overlapped until 6 months and gradually separatedthereafter. In this situation , the proportional hazard as-\nsumption for the Cox regression model does not hold.\nConsequently, it is not a robust method. Subsequently, weused the RMST model to calculate the survival differencesbetween the two curves using the RMST ratio, which behavesas an analog of the Cox proportional HR. The mortality riskdecreased by 38%, which was equivalent to RMST ratio 0.62(0.40-0.97) calculated at the placebo-gemcitabine versusnimotuzumab-gemcitabine direction, and the differences\nwere statistically signi ﬁcant. The RMST for both OS and PFS\nwas signi ﬁcantly longer in the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine\ngroup than in the control group. The 1-year and 3-year OSrates were 43.6% versus 26.8% and 13.9% versus 2.7% inthe investigational and control arms, respectively.

In a previous study, the median OS of gemcitabine\nmonotherapy was 5.65 months.\n13However, the median OS\nwas increased to 6.24 months when combined with\nerlotinib,17and 8.5 months and 1-year OS rate of 35%\nwhen albumin-paclitaxel was added to gemcitabine.18In\naddition to these regimens, the ﬂuorouracil, leucovorin,\nirinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) schedulehad the longest median survival time of 11.1 months;its usage is limited owing to side effects.\n19Compared\nwith the current treatment alternatives, the medianOS of nimotuzumab-gemcit abine in this study was\n10.9 months, and the 1-year OS rate was 43.6%, which was\nequal to that of the FOLFIRINOX regimen, but with abetter safety pro ﬁle.PFS was also signi ﬁcantly higher in the nimotuzumab arm,\naccording to the log-rank Pvalue and RMST method. The\nORRs of the two treatment groups were similar; however, the\nDCR and CBR were higher in the nimotuzumab group, al-\nthough the difference was not statistically signi ﬁcant. These\nresults indicate that nimotuzumab may improve diseasecontrol and slow the progression of advanced PC.\nIn the subgroup analyses, the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine\ncombination showed a greater bene ﬁt, which was consis-\ntent with the results of the total population analysis. Thesubgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution be-cause after adjusting the sample size, the subgroups weresmall. Regarding the safety pro ﬁle, AEs or ADRs were\ncomparable between the two groups and did not increaseafter the addition of nimotuzumab. The frequency of total\nhematologic or nonhematologic AEs (including grade\n3 AEs) >10% was similar betwe en the two groups.

This trial con ﬁrmed that nimotuzumab has a good\nsafety pro ﬁle.\nThe proportion of K-Ras wild-type tumors in our study was\n17.1%. This percentage was higher than the internationallyreported data, but similar to a previous nationwide study in\nChina (16.8%).\n20\nOne limitation of this study is that EGFR expression and other\ngenetic mutation types were not evaluated. It is unknownwhether patients with activation of the mitogen-activated\nprotein kinase pathway because of BRAF mutations would\nbeneﬁt from nimotuzumab treatment. Alternatively, other\nkinase fusion genes might confer sensitivity to nimotuzumab.Delineating the molecular subtypes of K-Ras wild-type tu-\nmors could improve patient selection for nimotuzumab\ntreatment.\nInformation on subsequent treatments after disease pro-\ngression was not collected, whi ch is another limitation of\nthis study.

Nimotuzumab is an EGFR monoclonal antibody thought to play a significant role in the treatment of GBM. This paper presents \na retrospective cohort study that evaluates the clinical efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab in GBM.\nMaterials and Methods:  A total of 56 newly diagnosed patients with EGFR-positive GBM were included in our study. The patients were divided \ninto radiotherapy (RT) + temozolomide (TMZ) + nimotuzumab (39 patients) and RT + TMZ (17 patients) groups based on whether or not nimotu -\nzumab was added during RT . Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicities were assessed.\nResults:  The median follow-up time was 27 .9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.1-30.8). The median PFS was 12.4 months (95% CI, \n7 .8-17 .0) and 8.2 months (95% CI, 6.1-10.3) in the 2 groups, respectively, P = .052. The median OS was 27 .3 months (95% CI, 19.0-35.6) and 16.7 \nmonths (95% CI, 11 .1-22.2), respectively, P = .018. In patients with unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter, \nthe PFS and OS were significantly better in patients treated with nimotuzumab than in those without nimotuzumab (median PFS: 19.3 vs 6.7 \nmonths, P = .001; median OS: 20.2 vs 13.8 months, P = .026). During the treatment period, no statistically significant difference in toxicity was \nnoted between the 2 groups.\nConclusion:  Our retrospective cohort study suggests the efficacy of Nimotuzumab combined with concurrent RT with TMZ in patients with \nnewly diagnosed EGFR-positive GBM, and specifically those with unmethylated MGMT promoter. Further prospective studies are warranted to \nvalidate our findings. Besides, nimotuzumab demonstrated good safety and tolerability.\nKey words:  glioblastoma; epidermal growth factor receptor; nimotuzumab; temozolomide; radiotherapy; survival.\nImplications for Practice\nThis study recruited treatment-naïve patients with glioblastoma (GBM) with positive EGFR expression. Of note, this is arguably the first \ncase-control study in China that targeted patients with EGFR-positive GBM. It was found that nimotuzumab combined with concurrent \nradiotherapy with temozolomide demonstrated efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed EGFR-positive GBM. The progression-\nfree survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients in the group that used nimotuzumab were superior to those that did not use \nnimotuzumab. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of nimotuzumab is an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS in patients \nwith EGFR-positive GBM. Further analysis showed that nimotuzumab could further improve the survival rate of patients with unmethylated \nO6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter. Nimotuzumab demonstrated good safety and tolerability. This may provide \na clinical reference for the treatment of GBM.\nIntroduction\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent primary brain \ntumor in adults, accounting for approximately 60%-70% \nof gliomas.1 It is poorly differentiated, aggressive, highly malignant, and has a poor prognosis.2,3 At present, its stan -\ndard treatment includes the maximum extent resection under \nthe premise of ensuring safety, concurrent chemoradio -\ntherapy (CCRT) with temozolomide (TMZ), and adjuvant \nReceived: 16 April 2022; Accepted: 8 September 2022.\n© The Author(s) 2022.

Nonetheless, these therapeu -\ntic approaches only prolong progression-free survival (PFS) \nto 6.9 months and overall survival (OS) to 14.6 months. \nEven with regular treatment, GBM with unmethylated \nO6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) pro -\nmoter has a worse prognosis, with a PFS of only 5.3 months \nand an OS of only 12.7 months.4 To enhance the survival of \nGBM, clinical studies of CCRT with TMZ combined with \ntargeted therapy, immunotherapy, or other chemotherapeutic \ndrugs have been actively implemented in China and abroad \nwith most still in phase I and II research stages, and few stud -\nies demonstrated the positive results.5-7 As such, it is necessary \nto identify novel treatments to further improve the outcome.\nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed \nto varying degrees in more than 40% of gliomas. Activation \nof the EGFR pathway is linked to tumor angiogenesis, tumor \ninvasion, and metastasis, as well as resistance to chemora -\ndiotherapy.8,9 Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal \nantibody against EGFR that specifically binds to EGFR, hin -\nders EGFR binding to its ligand, and finally impedes EGFR-\nmediated downstream signaling as well as suppresses tumor \ngrowth. Secondly, nimotuzumab mediates immune effects, \nincluding antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity \n(ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) that \ndirectly kill tumor cells. Furthermore, it forms a complex after \nbinding to EGFR; this complex then enters the cell through \nendocytosis and is degraded to achieve the anti-tumor effect. \nRadioimmunoassay has proven that nimotuzumab would \ncross the blood-brain barrier.10 Besides, it could improve the \nsensitivity of TMZ and radiotherapy (RT).11,12 Therefore, \nscholars believe that nimotuzumab could improve OS in pri -\nmary GBM theoretically. However, in clinical practice, there \nis little consensus on whether nimotuzumab improves the \nprognosis of primary GBM. A single-arm study in Shanghai \nHuashan Hospital enrolled 26 patients with GBM. All \npatients were subjected to CCRT and nimotuzumab. The PFS \nand OS were 10.0 and 15.9 months, respectively. Analysis \nshowed that the PFS and OS were not correlated with EGFR \nexpression. Nevertheless, the 12-month OS rate was better in \nEGFR-negative patients than that in EGFR-positive patients \n(90% vs. 53.8%, P = .07).13 A German-based randomized \ncontrolled study revealed that the OS and PFS of patients in \nthe nimotuzumab + CCRT group were superior to those of \npatients in the CCRT group. However, there was no statisti -\ncally significant difference (22.3 vs. 19.6 months, P = .4856; \n7.7 vs. 5.8 months P = .7898). Further analysis showed that \nthe PFS and OS of patients with EGFR amplification treated \nwith nimotuzumab are superior to those of patients with -\nout EGFR amplification (8.9 vs. 8.2 months, 21.2 vs. 17.2 \nmonths); besides, the 12-month PFS rate between the 2 groups \nwas similar in patients without EGFR amplification.14 A sin -\ngle-arm multicenter study in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer \nCenter enrolled 36 patients with positive EGFR expression, \nand as a result, the PFS was 11.9 months and the OS was \n24.5 months following the combined treatment with nimo -\ntuzumab. These findings are encouraging, however, the study \nhad no control group and was a single-arm study.15 Taken \ntogether, nimotuzumab maybe exerts more benefit to patients \nwith EGFR-positive GBM. Moreover, in head and neck squa -\nmous cell carcinomas, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, \nEGFR positivity is a biomarker for nimotuzumab. GBM \npatients with EGFR amplification had a poorer prognosis.16-18 \nWhether nimotuzumab improves survival in patients with EGFR-positive GBM remains unclear. The clinical efficacy and \nsafety of nimotuzumab combined with concurrent irradiation \nand TMZ in newly diagnosed patients with EGFR-positive \nGBM were evaluated in this single-center retrospective cohort \nstudy from China; the study matched other known factors \nthat may affect the prognosis of GBM.\nPatients and Methods\nPatient Characteristics\nData of 56 patients were retrospectively analyzed between \nMarch 2018 and November 2020 at the Xiangya Hospital of \nCentral South University. The main inclusion criteria included: \n(1) newly diagnosed patients; (2) histological diagnosis of \nGBM; (3) immunohistochemical EGFR positive (more than \n10% of tumor cells stained brownish-yellow were considered \npositive for EGFR expression.); (4) aged 18-70 years; (5) KPS \nscore ≥60; (6) good blood routine, liver and kidney function; \n(7) all patients experienced surgery and CCRT; and (8) com -\nplete follow-up data. On the other hand, the exclusion criteria \nincluded: (1) EGFR negative; (2) previous craniocerebral RT; \n(3) combined with other malignant tumors or serious dis -\neases; (4) missing reexamination data or follow-up data; and \n(5) patients could not tolerate combined therapy or refuse. \nBased on different treatment strategy patients were divided \ninto RT + TMZ + nimotuzumab or RT + TMZ groups and \nmatched the baseline data.\nTreatment Methods\nSurgical Stage\nSurgical stage involves the removal of the tumor to the great -\nest extent under the premise of ensuring safety. Patients in \nboth groups underwent tumor resection surgery. Based on the \ndegree of surgical resection, surgery was divided into gross \ntotal resection (GTR) (degree of resection 100%) and subto -\ntal resection (STR) (degree of resection 80%-90%).\nCCRT Stage\nIn CCRT stage, patients in both groups received intensi -\nty-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). On CT localization \nimages, we determined and delineated the tumor target area \n(total tumor volume (GTV), clinical tumor volume (CTV), \nand planned tumor volume (PTV) as well as vital tissues and \nnormal organs that need protection using preoperative and \npostoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as \nsurgical records and surgeon suggestions according to the \nEORTC target delineation principle. Oncologists and radiolo -\ngists identified residual GTV and tumor bed (GTVtb) as GTV \nunder joint reading. The CTV was a margin of 2 cm from \nthe GTV. The PTV was placed an additional 0.3 cm around \nthe CTV. RT was 2.0 Gy/day, 5 days a week for 60 Gy for 6 \nweeks. Starting on the first day of RT, a dose of 75 mg/m2/\nday of TMZ capsules was orally administered until the end of \nRT. Patients in the RT + TMZ + nimotuzumab arm received \nnimotuzumab weekly for 6 doses during RT. Nimotuzumab \nInjection 200 mg was diluted in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chlo -\nride solution, IVGTT, over 60 minutes.\nAC Phase\nIn AC phase, TMZ regimen was administered 4 weeks of rest \nafter RT. The dose of the first cycle was 150 mg/m2/day for 5 \nconsecutive days, with 23 days of rest, ie, 28 days as a course Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/advance-article/doi/10.1093/oncolo/oyac202/6743293 by guest on 24 October 2022\n\nThe Oncologist , 2022, Vol. XX, No. XX 3\nof treatment. In the absence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or \nthrombocytopenia in the first cycle, the dose was 200 mg/m2/\nday for 5 days with 23 days of rest, ie, 28 days as a course of \ntreatment from the second cycle. There were 6 cycles of AC if \nno progression occurred.\nEfficacy and Toxicities\nMRI re-examinations were performed at an interval of every \n2-3 months after CCRT until disease progression or death. \nEfficacy was assessed based on RANO criteria, which were \ndivided into complete response (CR), partial response (PR), \nstable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD). For the dif -\nferential diagnosis of tumor recurrence, particularly for the \npresence of new lesions in the radiation field within 3 months \nafter CCRT, the following factors were integrated for com -\nprehensive determination: the extent of surgical resection, \nmolecular pathology, time to recurrence, clinical symptoms, \ndynamic MRI T1-enhanced image changes, MRS, and PWI. If \nnecessary, multidisciplinary discussion was held. Patients were \nevaluated for toxicity based on the Common Terminology \nCriteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 5.0).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe primary study endpoints were PFS and OS. PFS was \ndefined as the time interval from diagnosis (date of surgery) \nto determination of tumor recurrence. OS was defined as the \ntime interval from the start of diagnosis to death. The base -\nline data and adverse reaction data of patients were analyzed \nthrough the direct counting method; the measurement data \nwere expressed by a median, and the χ2 test was used for com -\nparison. GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, \nCA, USA) and SPSS 23.0 statistical software were used for \nall statistical analyses. OS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier \nsurvival curves, and the difference in survival between the 2 groups was analyzed using the log-rank test; P < .05 was \nconsidered statistically significant. Cox proportional hazards \nmodel was used for multivariate analysis influencing PFS and \nOS.\nResults\nPatient Characteristics\nA total of 56 newly diagnosed GBM patients in our hospi -\ntal were enrolled between March 2018 and November 2020. \nEGFR immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining on \nthe cell membrane of slices in all patients. In total, 39 patients \nwere in the RT + TMZ + nimotuzumab group, including \n28 males and 11 females with an average age of 52 years \n(range 22-69 years). KPS at treatment initiation was 70 (range \n70-80). GTR was performed in 34 patients, STR in 5 patients, \nIDH wild-type in 38 patients, and IDH mutant in 1 patient; \n14 patients showed methylation of the MGMT promoter, \nwhereas 25 were unmethylated. Among the 17 patients in the \nRT + TMZ group, 12 were male and 5 were female with an \naverage age of 58 years (range 33-71 years). KPS at treatment \ninitiation was 70 (range 60-90). GTR was performed in 15 \npatients, STR in 2 patients, IDH wild-type in 16 patients, and \nIDH mutant in 1 patient; 4 patients showed MGMT promoter \nmethylation, whereas 13 were unmethylated. No significant \ndifferences were noted in gender, age, degree of surgical resec -\ntion, IDH status, or MGMT promoter status between the 2 \ngroups ( P > .05). Table 1  shows the comprehensive character -\nistics of GBM patients.\nEfficacy and Survival\nAs of 21 February 2022, the follow-up period was 27.9 \nmonths (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.1-30.8).

A \ntotal of 21 (53.8%) patients died. The estimated PFS rate \nwas 53.8% at first year, and 19.6% at second year. The esti -\nmated OS rate was 89.7% at the first year, and 54.1% at \nthe second year. For patients in the RT + TMZ group, the \nbest response as per the RANO assessment was complete \nresponse in 15 patients (88.2%), partial response in 1 patient \n(5.9%), and stable disease in 1 patient (5.9%). During fol -\nlow-up, 16 patients (94.1%) displayed progressive disease, \nincluding 10 in situ recurrences, 3 ectopic recurrences, and \n3 both in situ and ectopic recurrences; 13 (76.5%) patients \nsuccumbed. The estimated PFS rate was 23.5% at the first \nyear and 11.8% at the second year. The estimated OS rate \nwas 70.6% at the first year, and 20.2% at the second year. \nThe median PFS was 12.4 months (95% CI, 7.8-17.0) and \n8.2 months (95% CI, 6.1-10.3) in the 2 groups, respectively, \nP = .052. The median OS was 27.3 months (95% CI, 19.0-\n35.6) and 16.7 months (95% CI, 11.1-22.2) in the 2 groups, \nrespectively, P = .018 ( Figs. 1-2 ). Fig. 3  shows the MRI \nchanges in the patient.\nUnivariate analysis of known clinical prognostic factors \nshowed that patients with GTR of the tumor at the time of \nsurgery had a better PFS than those with STR ( P < .001). \nNotably, MGMT promoter methylation improved PFS and \nOS (P = .002; P = .028). In addition, the use of nimotuzumab \nimproved PFS and OS ( P = .052; P = .018). Multivariate anal -\nyses were performed for PFS and OS to adjust all factors listed in Table 2 . GTR was identified as an independent prognostic \nfactor for PFS ( P < .001). Also, MGMT promoters methyla -\ntion and the use of nimotuzumab were considered indepen -\ndent prognostic factors for PFS and OS ( P = .003, P = .016; \nP = .027, P = .008).\nAnalysis of MGMT promoter methylation status in the 2 \ngroups revealed that 14 patients in the nimotuzumab + and \nmethylated groups experienced a median PFS of 17.6 \nmonths (95% CI, 15.8-19.5) as well as a median OS of 28.9 \nmonths (95% CI, 26.7-31.1). The 25 patients in the nimotu -\nzumab + and unmethylated groups had a median PFS of 10.3 \nmonths (95% CI, 6.1-14.5) and a median OS of 21.3 months \n(95% CI, 17.9—24.7). The 4 patients in the nimotuzumab- \nand methylated groups had a median PFS of 19.3 months \n(95% CI, 8.5-30.1) and a median OS of 20.2 months. The \n13 patients in the nimotuzumab- and unmethylated groups \nhad a median PFS of 6.7 months (95% CI, 4.4-9.0) and a \nmedian OS of 13.8 months (95% CI, 10.2-17.5). In the group \nwithout nimotuzumab, patients with methylated MGMT \npromoter had significantly better PFS and OS than those \nwith unmethylated MGMT promoters ( P = .001; P = .026). \nNevertheless, in the group using nimotuzumab, no signifi -\ncant difference in PFS and OS was found between patients \nwith and without MGMT promoter methylation ( P = .077; \nP = .278). The comparison of patients with MGMT promoter \nmethylation showed no significant difference in PFS and OS \nbetween patients with and without nimotuzumab ( P = .772; \nP = .779). In patients with unmethylated MGMT promoter, \nPFS and OS were significantly better with nimotuzumab than \nin those without nimotuzumab ( P = .001; P = .001) ( Fig. 4 ).\nAdverse Events\nDuring the treatment period, no statistically significant \ndifference in toxicity was detected between the 2 groups. \nNimotuzumab combined with standard TMZ + RT was safe \nand well-tolerated by patients. No grade 3 or higher toxici -\nties were detected. Table 3  summarizes toxicity data for all \npatients. The most frequent toxicities during treatment were \nhematotoxicities, such as grades 1-2 neutropenia and grades \n1-2 thrombocytopenia. The remainder also had vomiting, \nconstipation, fatigue, dizziness, and increased liver trans -\naminase. After symptomatic treatment, the above toxicities \nwere improved. Four patients developed a rash, which was \nassociated with nimotuzumab. After the first treatment with \nnimotuzumab, the body temperature of one patient was 39.1 \n°C; this was considered an infusion reaction which was com -\npletely alleviated after symptomatic treatment.\nDiscussion\nPatients with GBM have a poor prognosis despite the success -\nful application of surgery and standard chemoradiotherapy.19 \nGene amplification and protein overexpression of EGFR has \nbeen detected in several GBM patients.20-22 Activation of EGFR \nsignaling causes uncontrolled tumor proliferation. However, \ntargeted therapy against EGFR amplification has emerged as \none of the therapeutic options for gliomas. Notably, nimo -\ntuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that detects \nthe extracellular domain of EGFR and competitively binds to \nEGFR, thereby inhibiting signaling pathways. Reports have \nshown that the distribution of nimotuzumab is tumor-spe -\ncific.23 Also, previous preclinical studies indicate that nimo -\ntuzumab improves radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity of \nFigure 1.

Of note, this is arguably the \nfirst cohort study in China that targets patients with EGFR-\npositive GBM. In total, we enrolled 56 patients for analysis. \nBy February 2022, the PFS and OS of patients in the group that used nimotuzumab were superior to those that did not \nuse nimotuzumab (12.4 vs. 8.2 months, P = .052; 27.3 vs. \n16.7 months, P = .018). Through multivariate analysis, we \nidentified that the use of nimotuzumab is an independent \nprognostic factor for PFS and OS in patients with EGFR-\npositive GBM ( P = .027 and .008, respectively). Notably, the \nprognosis of patients with EGFR-positive GBM treated with \nthe combination of nimotuzumab in our study exceeds that \nof all previous studies. A study by Du enrolled 36 patients \nwith EGFR-positive GBM. All patients received TMZ and \nnimotuzumab based on postoperative RT. Their PFS was 11.9 \nmonths (95% CI, 5.5-18.2) and OS was 24.5 months (95% \nFigure 2.

Because many studies have \nshown that GTR can improve GBM prognosis. According to \nWang et al, all GBM patients were treated with nimotuzumab, \nand in 50.0% (13/26) of EGFR-positive patients, PFS was 11 \nmonths and OS was only 13 months.13 Among them, the GTR \nrate was only 34.6%, and no pathological molecular markers \ninfluencing prognosis, including MGMT promoter methyla -\ntion status and IDH mutation status were mentioned in the \ntext. Westphal et al enrolled 20 patients with EGFR amplifi -\ncation and administered them with nimotuzumab; they found \nsuperior PFS and OS of 8.9 and 21.2 months, respectively, \ncompared to that in patients without EGFR amplification.14 \nThis was also lower than that in our study. However, they \ndid not provide comprehensive baseline data in the analysis of EGFR amplification, hence it was difficult to analyze the \nreason for the difference between our study and the results of \nthis study. Furthermore, the choice of salvage treatment after \nrelapse also influenced OS.\nDu et al enrolled 36 patients with EGFR-positive GBM \nand treated them with nimotuzumab. Based on the analysis \nof MGMT promoter methylation status, no significant differ -\nence in OS (24.5 vs. 22.9 months, P = .527) and PFS (9.1 vs. \n11.9 months, P = .752) was found between methylated and \nunmethylated patients.15 Westphal reported that patients with \nunmethylated MGMT promoter had a 4-month improvement \nin OS after treatment with nimotuzumab: 19.5 months (95% \nCI, 14.7-25.6) in the experimental group vs. 15.5 months \n(95% CI, 13.8-24.0) in the control group, P = .4578. However, \nthe authors concluded that nimotuzumab demonstrated a \nclear trend of efficacy and excellent safety in patients with \nMGMT promoter unmethylated glioblastoma.14 Our findings \nare similar to that of Westphal. Patients with unmethylated \nMGMT promoters were analyzed based on the application \nof nimotuzumab. Consequently, we found that patients who \nused nimotuzumab had significantly better PFS and OS than \nthose who did not use nimotuzumab (10.3 vs. 6.7 months, \nP = .001; 21.3 vs. 13.8, P = .001). At the same time, a Chi-\nsquare test was performed for baseline data in these 2 groups, \nand no differences were noted in age, gender, KPS score, \ndegree of tumor resection, or IDH mutation status. Thus, we \nbelieve that the combination of nimotuzumab + RT + TMZ \nhas an advantage over RT + TMZ in patients with unmethyl -\nated MGMT promoters.\nMany previous studies indicate that MGMT promoter \nmethylation is a good prognostic factor in glioblastoma.28,29 \nHere, both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed \nthat MGMT promoter methylation could significantly \ninfluence PFS and OS. In the group without nimotuzumab, \npatients with methylated MGMT promoter had signifi -\ncantly better PFS and OS than those with unmethylated \nMGMT promoter (19.3 vs. 6.7 months, P = .001; 20.2 vs. \n13.8 months, P = .026). This is also consistent with the find -\nings of previous studies. Nevertheless, in the group that was \nadministered with nimotuzumab, we found no significant \ndifference in PFS and OS between MGMT methylated and \nunmethylated patients (median PFS: 17.6 vs. 10.3 months, \nP = .077; median OS: 28.9 vs. 21.3 months, P = .278). This \nmay be attributed to the fact that nimotuzumab signifi -\ncantly improves the survival of patients with unmethylated \nMGMT promoters, hence the difference between patients T able 2.

Nonetheless, GTR did not \nshow a significant advantage in OS. This could be asso -\nciated with the aggressive treatment of our patient after \nrecurrence. Moreover, only 7 patients in our study were \nSTR, and the small sample size can potentially introduce \nbias in the results. Therefore, our findings require fur -\nther validation by subsequent studies with large samples.\nNo difference in toxicity was noted between patients who \ntook nimotuzumab and those who did not. After the com -\nbination of nimotuzumab and chemoradiotherapy, the treat -\nment-related AEs were small, and mostly grades I-II, there \nwas no grade III or higher adverse reactions. This is because \nnimotuzumab binds more to tumor cells with high EGFR \nexpression, whereas EGFR expression levels are low in nor -\nmal tissues, hence fewer adverse effects.\nOf course, our study also has certain limitations. Our \nstudy was a retrospective study with a small sample size. The \ndetermination of EGFR positivity in this study was based \non immunohistochemical analysis and could not distinguish \nbetween mutations and amplifications. In the future, we need \nto consider these factors comprehensively, expand the sample \nsize, and conduct prospective randomized controlled studies \nto verify these preliminary survival results.\nConclusion\nAccording to this single-center, retrospective, cohort study in \nChina, nimotuzumab combined with CCRT displayed supe -\nrior efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed EGFR-positive \nGBM, particularly those with unmethylated MGMT pro -\nmoter. And this combination therapy is safe and tolerable. \nHowever, a larger sample size and prospective randomized \ncontrolled studies are necessary to validate these preliminary \nsurvival results.Acknowledgments\nWe are grateful to all those who have contributed to this \nresearch.
