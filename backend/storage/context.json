Therefore, we conducted a phase III clinical study to verify\nthe efﬁcacy and safety of this combination regimen in patients with K-Ras wild-\ntype tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov identi ﬁer:NCT02395016 ).\nPATIENTS AND\nMETHODSEligible patients were randomly assigned to receive nimotuzumab (400 mg\nonce per week) or placebo followed by gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2on days 1, 8,\nand 15, once every 4 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nThe primary end point was overall survival (OS) and the secondary end pointswere progression-free survival (PFS), response rates, and safety.\nRESULTS A total of 480 patients were screened; 92 patients were enrolled and 82 patients\nwith K-Ras wild-type tumors were eligible. In the full analysis set, the median\nOS was 10.9 versus 8.5 months, while the restricted mean survival time (RMST)was 18.05 versus 11.14 months for the investigational versus control arm (ratioof control vinvestigation 50.62 [0.40-0.97]; P5.036). Median PFS was 4.2\nversus 3.6 months in the investigational versus control arm (log-rank P5.04;\nhazard ratio, 0.60 [0.37-0.99]) and the restricted mean PFS time was 8.08versus 4.76 months (RMST ratio, 0.58 [0.38-0.90]; P5.036). Both OS and PFS\nwere longer in the nimotuzumab group than in the placebo group. The objective\nresponse rates and disease control rates were 7% versus 10% and 68% versus\n63% for the investigational and control groups, respectively. The incidence ofadverse events were comparable between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION In patients with locally advanced or metastatic K-Ras wild-type PC, nimotu-\nzumab plus gemcitabine signi ﬁcantly improved OS and PFS with a good safety\nproﬁle.\nINTRODUCTION\nPancreatic cancer (PC) is a common and fatal malignancy\nthat occurs worldwide. Eighty percent of PC cases are di-\nagnosed as advanced or metastatic stage.1Twenty- ﬁve\npercent of patients with advanced PC are at a locally ad-vanced stage, with a median overall survival (mOS) of6-9 months. Approximately 60%-70% of patients withadvanced PC are at the metastatic stage, with mOS of only3-5 months.\n2–9Unfortunately, the current regimens are\nunsatisfactory. Encouraging the achievement of new reg-imens has been developed in many other cancer ﬁelds but\nrarely in PC. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective\ntherapies to prolong the survival of patients with PC.Nimotuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal\nantibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR). A phase IIb study (PCS07) done in Germany showedthat nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine might signi ﬁcantly\nimprove the mOS (8.6 months v6.0 months) of locally ad-\nvanced or metastatic PC, especially for the wild-type K-Rasgene subgroup (11.62 months v5.67 months; 1-year survival\nrates, 53.8% v15.8%, respectively).\n10In 2014, gemcitabine was\nwidely used and was considered the standard of care for ﬁrst-\nline treatment regimen for patients with advanced PC inChina. Thus, we conducted a phase III trial (NOTABLE study)to verify the ef ﬁcacy and safety of nimotuzumab plus gem-\ncitabine as ﬁrst-line treatment for patients with locally ad-\nvanced or metastatic PC.ACCOMPANYING CONTENT\nProtocol\nAccepted July 20, 2023\nPublished August 30, 2023\nJ Clin Oncol 00:1-11\n© 2023 by American Society ofClinical Oncology\nView Online\nArticle\nCreative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial No Derivatives\n4.0 License\nascopubs.org/journal/jco | Volume nnn, Issue nnn |1\nDownloaded from ascopubs.org by 66.96.253.194 on September 18, 2023 from 066.096.253.194\nCopyright © 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

The principal investigators from each site adhered to\nthe study protocol. In addition, data were collected andanalyzed by professional third-party statisticians who cer-tiﬁed the accuracy and completeness of the reported data.\nPatents\nPatients with locally advanced or metastatic PC were\nscreened.

Thepatients were followed up until death or study completion.\nPatients were strati ﬁed by tumor localization (head, body, or\ntail of the pancreas) according to previous surgery, history ofbiliary obstruction treatment, and adjuvant chemotherapy.\nAssessments\nThe investigators evaluated t he tumor response via computed\ntomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan every8 weeks, according to RECIST ver sion 1.1. The clinical bene ﬁt\nresponse (CBR) was evaluated every 8 weeks on the basis of theBurris criteria.\n13Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse\nevents were monitored by the investigators from the beginningof the treatment and up to 30 days after treatment completion.\nThe detected events were graded according to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03,\n14and\ncoded and summarized according to the preferred terms in theMedical Dictionary for Regulato ry Activities, version 24.0.\nStudy End Points\nThe primary end point was overall survival (OS), de ﬁned as\nthe time from random assignment to death due to anycause. Subgroup analyses of OS were based on prespeci ﬁed\nstratiﬁcation factors. The secondary end points were\nprogression-free survival (PFS), de ﬁned as the time from\nrandom assignment until objective tumor progression ordeath; time to progression (TTP, de ﬁned as the time from\nrandom assignment until objective tumor progression);objective response rate (ORR), including complete responseCONTEXT\nKey Objective\nDoes nimotuzumab (a humanized epithelial growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody) plus gemcitabine regimen provide\nan overall survival (OS) bene ﬁt for patients with locally advanced or metastatic K-Ras wild-type pancreatic cancer (PC)?\nKnowledge Generated\nIn a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, phase III clinical trial in China, patients with locally advanced or metastaticK-Ras wild-type PC were enrolled.

Treatment-related ad-\nverse events (TRAEs) were de ﬁned as adverse drug reac-\ntions (ADRs).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe primary end point was evaluated in the full analysis set(FAS; all eligible patients who received at least one dose ofnimotuzumab and had one evaluation of ef ﬁcacy). Secondary\nend points were analyzed only in the FAS. A prespeci ﬁed\nsubgroup analysis of OS and PFS was performed using theFAS. Safety analysis was performed using the safety analysisset (SS; patients received at least one antibody dose).\nStatistical analyses were performed using the SAS version\n9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). OS was the primary ef ﬁcacy\nend point and was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier\nmethod and strati ﬁed log-rank test. If the proportional\nhazards assumption was unsatisfactory (eg, survival curvecrossover), the restricted mean survival time (RMST)model\n15was used to analyze the survival bene ﬁt differ-\nence. RMST is suggested as a novel alternative measure insurvival analyses and may be us eful when the proportional\nhazards assumption cannot be made. A right-censored\np a t t e r nw a su s e df o rt h eO Sd a t a .T h et i m ep o i n to ft h e\nRMST model was the closest to the end of the trial.\nWe calculated that, with a sample of 276 patients, the study\nwould have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) fordeath with nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine (investigationalarm, or nimotuzumab-gemcitabine) versus placebo plusgemcitabine (control arm, or placebo-gemcitabine) of 0.69.\nThis estimation was based on the results of the full pop-\nulation in the PCS07 study, where the median OS of thegemcitabine monotherapy group was 6 months and themedian OS of the investigational arm was 8.7 months. Sincepatients with K-Ras wild-type PC were rare and recruitmentwas dif ﬁcult, we calculated that with a sample of 79 patients\nand 64 events, the study would have 80% power to detecta HR for death with nimotuzumab-gemcitabine versus\nplacebo-gemcitabine. This assumption was made on the\nbasis of the result of patients with K-Ras wild-type PC inPCS07 study, where the median OS of gemcitabine mono-therapy group was 5.67 months, and the median survival ofthe investigational group was 11.62 months. The sample sizere-estimation was approved by the Chinese regulatory au-thorities. At the time of approval, 92 patients were enrolledand the study was terminated.\nMultivariate analysis of survival data was conducted using\nthe Cox proportional hazard model according to prespeci ﬁed\nstratiﬁcation factors to evaluate the treatment effect. In\naddition to the HR as a measurement of the relative risk of anevent, the RMST ratio between arms (control vinvestigation)\nwas estimated after adjusting for covariates. For this anal-\nysis, a ratio of <1 indicated survival improvement in theinvestigational arm. Unlike the HR, the RMST ratio does not\nrely on any model assumption.\n16\nThe ORR was analyzed using the Fisher test, while the DCRand CBR were evaluated using the chi-squared test. AEs wereclassiﬁed according to the system organ class, preferred\nterm, or severity grade.\nRESULTS\nPatients and Treatment Groups\nA total of 480 patients from 25 study sites in China werescreened between April 2015 and March 2021. Then, 92patients with the K-Ras wild-type gene were eligible for\nrandom assignment, and 90 patients were allocated for\ntreatment. Eight patients who did not have K-Ras wild-typetumors according to a gene con ﬁrmatory procedure (seven\ncases) or PC (one gallbladder carcinoma case), detectedduring monitoring, were excluded. Finally, 82 patients wereanalyzed as part of the FAS, and 41 were included in eachgroup. The FAS group was the modi ﬁed intent-to-treat\ngroup ( Fig 1 ).\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline\nwere well balanced between the two groups ( Table 1 ).\nEfﬁcacy\nOS\nThe OS analysis was based on 76 deaths, including 36 deaths\nin the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group and 40 deaths in theplacebo-gemcitabine group. The mean follow-up time was57.6 months and 16.6 months, respectively, for the two\ngroups. The data cutoff was January 27, 2022. The median OS\nwas 10.9 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 16.3) in the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group and 8.5 months (95% CI, 5.7 to 10.0) in theplacebo-gemcitabine group (Cox proportional HR, 0.66; 95%CI, 0.42 to 1.05; log-rank P5.08;Fig 2A ). When using RMST\nmodel, the RMST was 18.05 months (95% CI, 11.71 to 24.38) inthe nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group and 11.14 months (95%CI, 8.07 to 14.20) in the placebo-gemcitabine group (RMST\nratio of control vtreatment, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.97;\nP5.036; Table 2 ). OS was signi ﬁcantly longer in the\nnimotuzumab-gemcitabine group ( Fig 2C ).\nPFS and TTP\nPFS was signi ﬁcantly longer in the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine\ngroup than in the placebo-gemcitabine group, with mediansurvival time of 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.7 to 7.3) versus3.6 months (95% CI, 2.0 to 5.0; HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37 to0.99; log-rank P5.04), respectively ( Fig 2B ). At a follow-\nup of 31 months, the restricted mean PFS time was8.08 months (95% CI, 5.20 to 10.94) in the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group and 4.76 months (95% CI, 3.41 to 6.09)\nin the placebo-gemcitabine group (RMST ratio, 0.58;\nJournal of Clinical Oncology ascopubs.org/journal/jco | Volume nnn, Issue nnn |3Nimotuzumab Plus Gemcitabine for K-Ras Pancreatic Cancer\nDownloaded from ascopubs.org by 66.96.253.194 on September 18, 2023 from 066.096.253.194\nCopyright © 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

No grade 4-5 AEs were\nobserved in this trial.\nDISCUSSION\nThis prospective, randomized , controlled, double-blind,\nmulticenter clinical trial demonstrated that nimotuzumabcombined with gemcitabine prolonged the median OS time\nby 2.4 months and decreased the mortality risk by 34%compared with the placebo gr oup by Cox regression. Once\nthe trial was completed, we observed that the survivalcurves overlapped until 6 months and gradually separatedthereafter. In this situation , the proportional hazard as-\nsumption for the Cox regression model does not hold.\nConsequently, it is not a robust method. Subsequently, weused the RMST model to calculate the survival differencesbetween the two curves using the RMST ratio, which behavesas an analog of the Cox proportional HR. The mortality riskdecreased by 38%, which was equivalent to RMST ratio 0.62(0.40-0.97) calculated at the placebo-gemcitabine versusnimotuzumab-gemcitabine direction, and the differences\nwere statistically signi ﬁcant. The RMST for both OS and PFS\nwas signi ﬁcantly longer in the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine\ngroup than in the control group. The 1-year and 3-year OSrates were 43.6% versus 26.8% and 13.9% versus 2.7% inthe investigational and control arms, respectively.

In a previous study, the median OS of gemcitabine\nmonotherapy was 5.65 months.\n13However, the median OS\nwas increased to 6.24 months when combined with\nerlotinib,17and 8.5 months and 1-year OS rate of 35%\nwhen albumin-paclitaxel was added to gemcitabine.18In\naddition to these regimens, the ﬂuorouracil, leucovorin,\nirinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) schedulehad the longest median survival time of 11.1 months;its usage is limited owing to side effects.\n19Compared\nwith the current treatment alternatives, the medianOS of nimotuzumab-gemcit abine in this study was\n10.9 months, and the 1-year OS rate was 43.6%, which was\nequal to that of the FOLFIRINOX regimen, but with abetter safety pro ﬁle.PFS was also signi ﬁcantly higher in the nimotuzumab arm,\naccording to the log-rank Pvalue and RMST method. The\nORRs of the two treatment groups were similar; however, the\nDCR and CBR were higher in the nimotuzumab group, al-\nthough the difference was not statistically signi ﬁcant. These\nresults indicate that nimotuzumab may improve diseasecontrol and slow the progression of advanced PC.\nIn the subgroup analyses, the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine\ncombination showed a greater bene ﬁt, which was consis-\ntent with the results of the total population analysis. Thesubgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution be-cause after adjusting the sample size, the subgroups weresmall. Regarding the safety pro ﬁle, AEs or ADRs were\ncomparable between the two groups and did not increaseafter the addition of nimotuzumab. The frequency of total\nhematologic or nonhematologic AEs (including grade\n3 AEs) >10% was similar betwe en the two groups.

This trial con ﬁrmed that nimotuzumab has a good\nsafety pro ﬁle.\nThe proportion of K-Ras wild-type tumors in our study was\n17.1%. This percentage was higher than the internationallyreported data, but similar to a previous nationwide study in\nChina (16.8%).\n20\nOne limitation of this study is that EGFR expression and other\ngenetic mutation types were not evaluated. It is unknownwhether patients with activation of the mitogen-activated\nprotein kinase pathway because of BRAF mutations would\nbeneﬁt from nimotuzumab treatment. Alternatively, other\nkinase fusion genes might confer sensitivity to nimotuzumab.Delineating the molecular subtypes of K-Ras wild-type tu-\nmors could improve patient selection for nimotuzumab\ntreatment.\nInformation on subsequent treatments after disease pro-\ngression was not collected, whi ch is another limitation of\nthis study. Third, although there were no statistically\nsigniﬁcant differences in baseline c haracteristi cs between\nthe two arms, nimotuzumab-tre ated patients were slightly\nyounger and had a better performance status. These fea-\ntures may have led to the improved treatment compliance.\nFinally, the study protocol was formulated in 2014,\nwhen the standard of care of ﬁrst-line treatment regimens\nin China was gemcitabine monotherapy.

No grade 3 or above toxicities were observed. \nCIMa Her  \nnimotuzumab 50 mg\nConclusions:\nAG regimen was the most common therapy in clinical practice in China. The real - \nworld study displayed the addition of nimo  would prolong the survival for APC, \nwith a good safety profile. \nCIMa Her  \nnimotuzumab 50 mg\nThank you",

OVERALL SUMMARY  \nKnowledge of the epidermal growth factor receptor’s (EGFR) function in the malignant process \nhas advanced enormously during the past decade. Its overexpression has been better characterized \nby different tumor  types but  also linked to a worse patient prognosis as well as radiotherapy and \nchemotherapy resistance. Additionally, the EGFR signaling pathway is known to contribute to \nseveral tumorigenic processes such as tumor  proliferation, apoptosis resistance, angiogenesis, \ninvasion and metastasis. Therefore, t he EGFR receptor was identified as a promising therapeutic \ntarget and several therapeutic drugs, such as EGFR -directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and \nanti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), have been developed in different malignancies. \nAlthough the  benefit of TKIs in association with chemotherapy remains to be seen, anti -EGFR \nmAbs display marked results in combination with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, \nmost of  these agents are commonly associated with a skin toxicity that appears as, among other \nthings, an acneiform rash, skin dryness and nail changes that can be severe and adversely affect \nquality of life.  Current knowledge has led to the belief that this tox icity of the EGFR inhibitor \nclass (i.e rash) is a hallmark of activity.  \nNimotuzumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody directed against the human EGFR for use \nas monotherapy and in combination with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy for the treatment \nof malignant diseases.  Nimotuzumab is alternatively referred to as TheraCIM h -R3, Theraloc®, \nCIMAher®, BIOMAb®-EGFR, Tai Xin Sheng®, OSAG -101, YMB -1000; or DE -766 however, \nnimotuzumab will be used throughout the Investigator’s Brochure.  \nNimotuzumab recognizes the human EGFR, thereby blocking the binding of its ligands and \ninducing inhibition of cell proliferation, pro -apoptotic signals, ADCC, CDC, and decreasing \nVEGF production. Nimotuzumab’s capacity to bind EGFR, in contrast with other anti-EGFR \nmAbs, is heavily dictated by cell receptor density. While it has similar preclinical and clinical \nactivity when compared to other anti -EGFR mAbs in certain indications, it has one major \ndifference: lack of severe skin toxicity as well as severe h ypomagnesemia and gastrointestinal \nadverse events. It is hypothesized that due to differences in its binding properties, nimotuzumab’s \nactivity is mechanistically different from the other mAbs. It has been shown preclinically that in \nsituations where EGFR density is low, like skin, the mAbs rely on one arm to bind to the EGFR \nepitope and cause its effect (monovalent binding). The level of EGFR blockade achieved is \ndetermined by the antibody’s specific binding affinity. In situations where receptor density i s high, \nas in certain tumors, mAb binding occurs via both arms (bivalent binding). Bivalent binding results \nin the formation of more stable bonds since it is dictated by the antibody’s avidity of binding as \nopposed to its binding affinity. Unlike  cetuximab and panitumumab, nimotuzumab binding has \nbeen shown to be highly dependent on EGFR density, binding only transiently in conditions of \nlow EGFR density , while achieves  an accumulation pattern like cetuximab and panitumumab in \nconditions of high EGFR densit y. This observation suggests that nimotuzumab relies on bivalent \nbinding for effective EGFR blockade, allowing nimotuzumab to bind robustly in tumors,  \noverexpressing EGFR while sparing low EGFR -expressing normal tissue, thereby avoiding \nunwanted toxicities.  \nA comprehensive battery of pharmacological testing has been performed with nimotuzumab. \nIn vitro  binding assays have shown that nimotuzumab has high affinity binding to human lung \nadenocarcinoma, breast and vulvar epidermoid carcinomas and specifically recognize  \nEGFR/HER -1 but not HER -2, HER -3 or HER -4. Immunohistochemistry studies have \ndemonstrated that nimotuzumab recognizes EGFR on a large number of epithelial tumor  tissues. \nThis is an expected outcome as tumors of epithelial origin have high EGFR expres sion.  In vitro  \npharmacology studies have shown the potential for nimotuzumab to inhibit cell proliferation and \nact as a cytostatic agent.  In addition, in vitro  studies have demonstrated that nimotuzumab inhibits \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 13 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         EGF -dependent EGFR phosphorylation as well as increases the radiosensitivity of either NSCLC \nor glioma cell lines expressing high or moderate levels of EGFR.  \nNimotuzumab inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis, and induced apoptosis in A431 human \nvulvar epidermoid carcinoma xenografts in SCID mice.  When administered in combination with \nradiotherapy, nimotuzumab significantly delayed tumor  growth, inhibited angiogenesis, reduced \nthe tumor  proliferation index, increased the number of apoptotic cells and reduced the \nphosphorylation activity of the EGFR in NMRI mice implanted with U87 glioma xenografts.  The \nantibody has also shown the ability to decrease the freque ncy of the radio -resistant CD133+cancer \nstem cells population in U87MG xenografts, even when it is administered concomitant to \nradiotherapy. In vitro  experiments conducted in this tumor model suggest that colocalization of \nthe EGFR and the CD133 marker on tumor cells would be responsible for this activity.  \nThe combination of nimotuzumab and radiation also inhibited tumor  growth in athymic mice \nimplanted with H292 and Ma -1 xenografts which express high or moderate levels of EGFR.  In \naddition, the combination of CPT -11 plus nimotuzumab showed greater inhibition of tumor  growth \nin an athymic mice implanted with gastric GCIY xenografts compared to single agent \nadministration.  \nNimotuzumab has also showing ability to kill EGFR+ cells by activating NK cells, stimulating \nthe ADCC activity and to induce the expansion of EGFR specific T cells subpopulations in treated \npatients, su ggesting a potential role in the activation of cellular antitumor responses.  \nNo evidence of systemic drug - or treatment -related toxicity of nimotuzumab was observed in \nrats after repeated daily administration over a 14 -day period at a dose level up to 57.14 mg/kg, \nequivalent to approximately 10 -fold the proposed maximum clinical da ily dose of 400 mg.  Daily \nintravenous administration of nimotuzumab at a dose level of 0.85 mg/kg (equivalent to a \ncumulative dose of more than 2.5 -fold the maximum proposed single human therapeutic dose of \n400 mg) for 14 days in monkeys was associated wi th minimal toxicity. At dose levels up to 11.4 \nmg/kg, there was no evidence of detrimental pharmacological or toxicological effects in monkeys.  \nRepeated weekly intravenous administration of up to 50.00 mg/kg nimotuzumab (approximately \n8.75-fold the propos ed maximum clinical daily dose of 400 mg) for 26 weeks in monkeys was not \nassociated with any significant toxicological findings or evidence of detrimental pharmacological \neffects.  \nA total of 51 clinical trials  has been completed with nimotuzumab for several cancer indications, \nincluding:  \n• Eleven  (11) trials in glioma, conducted in Cuba ( IIC RD EC -053, IIC RD EC -069, IIC RD \nEC-0114, M9/CIMAB/AEC -03, Cuba and Brazil (IIC RD EC -097 / EF -090), Germany \n(BN-001 PED -04, OSAG -101-BSC -05, OSAG -101-BSA -05), Canada (YMB -1000 -013), \nChina (BT -NI-GL-01), and India (CLG007/BIO005/GLIO/h -R3/2005) ; \n• Eleven  (11) trials  in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, conducted in Canada \n(YMB -1000 -004), Cuba (IIC RD EC -040, IIC RD EC -046, IIC RD EC -055, IIC RD EC -\n076, IIC RC -EC-0113, M9/CIMAB/AEC -04, China ( BPL-SCCHN -RWS -1) and India  \n(Nimotuzumab/SCCHN/2010 , hR3/SCCHN/001/IND, CLG16/BIO009/SCCHN/h -\nR3/2006);  \n• Seven (7) trials in non -small cell lung cancer, conducted in Canada ( YMB -1000 -010, \nYMB -1000 -018); Cuba (IIC RD EC -079, IIC RD EC -0147), India \n(CLG032/BIO013/NSCLC/H -R3/2008) and Japan (DE766 -A-J202, DE766 -A-J303);   \n• Six (6) trials in esophageal cancer, conducted in Cuba ( IIC RD EC -075, IIC RD EC -0163 ), \nBrazil (EF024 -201), China (BT -ESO -1001 , BT-ESO -901) and Japan (DE766 -A-J102);   \n• Two (2) trials in solid tumor s, conducted in Canada (YMB -1000 -007) and Japan (DE766 -\nA-J101);  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 14 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         • Four (4) trials in pancreatic cancer, conducted in Germany ( HH-2004/2, OSAG 101 -PCS-\n07, Cuba ( IIC RD EC -0166 ), and China ( BPL-Nim-PC-1);  \n• Two (2) trials in colorectal cancer, conducted in Canada (YMB -1000 -015) and Cuba (IIC \nRD EC -134);  \n• One (1) trial in breast cancer, conducted in Cuba (IIC RD EC -070);  \n• One (1) trial in tumor s of epithelial origin, conducted in Cuba (IIC RD EC -035);  \n• One (1) trial in prostate cancer, conducted in Cuba (IIC RD EC -074);  \n• One (1) trial on hepatic cancer, conducted in Cuba (IIC RD EC -084);  \n• Two (2) trials in gastric cancer, conducted in Japan and South Korea (DE766 -A-J201/08 -\nTH-8201) and Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (DE766 -A-J302).  \n• Two (2) trial s in nasopharyngeal cancer, conducted in China (2002SL0008 , BT-CT-001); \n \nThe clinical development program in oncology includes an additional 23 clinical trials currently \nongoing to investigate the safety and efficacy of nimotuzumab in 9 different localizations, \nincluding breast, cervical, colorectal, esophageal, glioma, head and neck, non -small cell lung, \nprostate cancer  and solid tumors.  \nIn addition , a new clinical study has evaluated the safety and therapeutic efficacy of \nnimotuzumab in SARS -CoV -2 positive patients under severe condition  (IIC RD EC -182), \nextending the application of the drug further beyond oncology . \nTaking into consideration the above information, to  date over 5653  patients have been enrolled \nin the completed clinical trials, 3823  of them treated with nimotuzumab and 1830  included in the \ncontrol group .

INTRODUCTION  \nNimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the Epidermal Growth Factor \nReceptor (EGFR), a key target in the development of cancer therapeutics.  EGFR targeting drugs \nhave been shown to improve response when used with conventional treatments s uch as radiation \ntherapy and chemotherapy.  EGFR (HER -1, erbB1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a \nmember of the erbB family of receptors, which includes HER -2 (erbB2), HER -3, and HER -4.  \nEGFR is activated by ligand binding, resulting in homo - or hetero -dimerization and the activation \nof tyrosine kinases, thereby activating downstream mitogenic activators. EGFR is a normal \nepithelial cell surface receptor, which is particularly active in tissues such as the epithelial lining \nof the gastrointestinal tract  and in skin follicles.  However, there is well -documented evidence that \nup-regulation of the EGFR signal transduction pathway is involved in the establishment and spread \nof tumor s of epithelial cell origin (Brabender 2001; Nicholson 2001).  Thus, agents t hat bind to \nand inhibit EGFR dimerization would be expected to exert antagonistic biological activity ( e.g., \ngrowth inhibition of cells requiring these ligands for proliferation).  \nEGFR is over -expressed in a wide variety of human tumor s, including non -small cell lung \n(Brabender 2001; Nicholson 2001), astrocytic (Liberman 1984; FeldKamp 1997), head and neck \n(Kearsley 1991; Rikimaru 1992), ovarian (Alper 2001), cervical (Bianco 2000; Ngan 2001), \nbladder (Chow 2001), and esophageal (Inada 1999; Wang 1999).  EGFR expression is also \ncorrelated with alterations in cell cycle progression (Giordano 1998), increased tumor  cell \ninvasiveness (Damstrup 1998), enhanced angiogenesis (Petit 1997; K erbel 1998a), and decreased \napoptosis of tumor  cells (Gibson 1999). Overexpression of EGFR in tumor s correlates with \nincreased metastasis, decreased survival, and poor prognosis.  EGFR protects malignant tumor  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 15 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         cells from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, making these treatments less \neffective.  \nSeveral strategies have been developed to disrupt EGFR signal transduction. Nimotuzumab is \none such agent that acts in this way. Nimotuzumab prevents dimerization of the receptor, thereby \ninhibiting tyrosine kinase activity and interfering with cell signal ing pathways involved in cell \nproliferation, metastasis, and repair.  \nOther monoclonal antibodies specifically targeting the extracellular domain of EGFR are in \nvarious stages of development, including cetuximab and panitumumab, which have obtained FDA \nregulatory clearance as oncology treatments. Nimotuzumab has been approve d in ex -USA markets \nbut a major market approval is pending.  \nExperiments have shown that nimotuzumab requires bivalent binding (attachment with both \nantibody arms to two EGF receptors) for efficient accumulation on cellular surface, in a manner \nanalogous to the binding of trastuzumab ( Herceptin®) to the  HER -2 receptor. The ability to form \nbivalent bonds is a function of EGFR density on the cellular surface. Consequently, nimotuzumab \nselectively targets and is active against cells that over -express EGFR, such as tumor  cells, whereas \nactivity against normal cells with low EGFR expression is limited.  \nThis selectivity contrasts with  other EGFR -targeting antibodies, which have significant \nmonovalent binding to the receptor (i.e. with a single arm) and inhibit normal EGFR functioning \neven when EGFR expression is low, thereby repressing normal EGFR activity in healthy tissues \n(e.g.: ski n).  \nThe selective accumulation of nimotuzumab on cancer cells over -expressing the EGFR is a \nmechanistic explanation for the very low incidence of side -effects with this antibody compared to \nEGFR -targeting molecules such as cetuximab (Erbitux®) and panitumumab (Vectibix®).  \nAdditionally, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target the intracellular domain of \nEGFR and inhibit adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding are also under development, with some \nhaving already been granted marketing authorization.  \n3. PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND PHARMACEUTICAL \nPROPERTIES AND FORMULATION  \n3.1 Drug Substance  \n \nNimotuzumab is an IgG subtype 1 kappa monoclonal antibody of approximately 151,000 \ndaltons.  The light chain is approximately 23,000 daltons and the heavy chain approximately \n52,000 daltons.  \nInitially, a murine ascites derived monoclonal antibody m -R3 (also known as ior egf/r3) was \ndeveloped at the Centre for Molecular Immunology (CIM).  This antibody recognizes the human \nEGFR and inhibits binding of EGF to the receptor (Fernández 1989, 1992).   Due to the potential \ndetrimental clinical consequences ( e.g., immunogenic response) of using an antibody of murine \norigin, a humanized version of the antibody was constructed.  Nimotuzumab was subsequently \nobtained by amplification and cloning of the DNA  fragments encoding the Complementarity \nDetermining Regions (CDR) of the heavy (V H) and light (V k) chain variable regions of m -R3 into \na human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 backbone (Mateo 1997).  Initially this antibody lacked binding \naffinity for EGFR.  However, a reshaped antibody was constructed by identifying and mutating 3 \namino acid residues of muri ne origin (Ser75, Thr76, Thr93) from the non -CDR framework regions \nof the IgG heavy chain into the human framework of the new antibody and full binding affinit y \nfor the antigen was restored.  \nNimotuzumab is generated by a well -characterized mouse myeloma host cell system (NS0). \nThe antibody is produced by continuous culture in a stirred tank perfusion fermentation process \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 16 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         and purified to yield the drug substance. The manufacturing process for nimotuzumab drug \nsubstance previously employed hollow fiber (HF) perfusion fermentation technology. This process \nwas performed for two years and mainly for research purposes. Early in the  clinical development \nof this product, the process was switched to a 30 L scale stirred tank (ST) perfusion fermentation \nprocess since it is more amenable to commercial scale up. The switch from HF to ST technology \noccurred in 2001; part of the preclini cal studies described in this Investigator’s Brochure were \ncarried out using product derived from the original HF process.  However, an extensive analysis \nof product comparability between the 30 L scale ST and HF process  has shown that the molecules \nhave demonstrated equivalence.  In addition, the ST process has been scaled 3 times, from 30 L to \ninitial commercial level  of 300 L, from 300 L to 500 L and lately from 500 L to 2000 L and \nsubsequent comparability studies have been carried out to demonstrate equ ivalence.   \nSince 2004, the non - clinical research has been performed with 300 L fermentation scale.  \nToxicokinetic studies and the 14 -day and 6 -month chronic toxicology studies in monkeys were \nperformed using ST materials, 300 L and 500 L materials.   \nThe 300 L fermentation line was discontinued since 2009, keeping only a 500 L scale in CIM \nPlant II. Later in 2011, 500 L scale was also discontinued and the 2000 L stirred tank fermentation \nprocess was established as the commercial scale in Antyter facili ty, inside CIM campus.  \nIn parallel, in the year 2008, a nimotuzumab manufacturing facility based in Beijing, China, \nwas accepted as an alternative manufacturing site for drug substance and drug product, with initial \ncommercial scale of 1000 L in stirred tank perfusion mode for f ermentation process. Pivotal \nclinical trials and commercial distribution since they have been performed, particularly, but not \nlimited to nasopharyngeal, pancreatic and esophageal cancer. Since 2010 another fermentation line \nof 2500 L scale started operati ng, and more recently a third line of 4000 L was added. . \n \n \n3.2 Formulation of Dosage Form, Storage and Handling  \n \nNimotuzumab  as final product  is a sterile, transparent , colorless solution  of pH 6.5 to 7.5.

NONCLINICAL STUDIES  \n \n4.1 Introduction . \n \nInnoCIMAb and partners have conducted supportive nonclinical pharmacology, \npharmacokinetic, biodistribution and toxicology studies with nimotuzumab.  The results of the in \nvitro  and in vivo pharmacology studies are presented in Section 4.2. Pharmacokinetic and \nbiodistribution studies have been performed in mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys and baboons and the \nresults are summarized in Section 4.3. Single and repeat -dose toxicity studies have been performed \nin rats and monkeys for up to 6 months.  An overview of the results from the toxicology studies is \npresented in Section 4.4.  \n \n4.2 Nonclinical Pharmacology . \n \nThe pharmacological activity of nimotuzumab has been evaluated in 7 in vitro  binding and \nimmunohistochemistry studies, 4 in vitro  pharmacology studies and 6 in vivo studies.  \nTo characterize the effects of nimotuzumab , in vitro receptor binding and immunohistochemical \nstudies have been conducted in tumor  tissues. An overview of the results of these studies is \nprovided in Appendix A, Table A - 1. In vitro  pharmacology studies have been performed to \ncharacterize the apoptotic and antiproliferative effects of nimotuzumab and to characterize the \ninhibition of EGF dependent EGFR phosphorylation and radiosensitivity effects of nimotuzumab \nin NSCLC cell lines, as  well as to explore a potential ability of the nimotuzumab to induce immune \nantitumor responses probably related to long -term clinical responses observed in patients treated \nwith the drug ( Appendix A, Table A - 2). In vivo pharmacology studies in immuno -compromised \nmice to determine the effect of nimotuzumab on tumor s have also been performed ( Appendix A, \nTable A - 3). \nIn vitro  studies have demonstrated that nimotuzumab inhibits EGFR activation and requires \nbivalent binding for efficient accumulation on the cell surface.  Studies have shown that \nnimotuzumab has a binding affinity in the order of 10-9 M to EGFR, specifically recognizes \nEGFR/HER -1 but not HER -2, HER -3 or HER -4 and demonstrates positive recognition to fetal and \nadult tissues rich in EGFR and tumor s of epithelial origin.   \nNimotuzumab has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, induce cell cycle arrest in the G1 \nphase of cell  division and induce down regulation of VEGF production. Furthermore, in vitro  \nstudies have demonstrated that nimotuzumab has immunological activity; specifically, \nnimotuzumab mediates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity and complement dependent \ncytotoxicity. In vitro  studies have also demonstrated that nimotuzumab inhibits EGF -dependent \nEGFR phosphorylation in NSCLC cell lines, H292 and Ma -1, expressing high or moderate levels \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 18 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         of EGFR.  Nimotuzumab also sensitized the H292,  and Ma -1 cell to the cytotoxic effects of \nradiation in vitro . \nNimotuzumab inhibited tumor  growth and angiogenesis, and induced apoptosis in SCID mice \nimplanted with A431 human vulvar epidermoid carcinoma xenografts. When administered in \ncombination with radiotherapy, nimotuzumab significantly delayed tumor  growth, inhibited \nangiogenesis, reduced the tumor  proliferation index, increased the number of apoptotic cells and \nreduced the phosphorylation activity of the EGFR in NMRI mice implanted with U87 glioma \nxenografts. In this glioma model, nimotuzumab has shown the ability to target the radio resistant  \nCD133+ cancer stem cell population, either administered as a monotherapy or in combination with \nradiation, suggesting a role as radiosensitizer. The capacity of the antibody to target this CD133+ \npopulation seems to be related to its antiangiogenic activity in this tumor model. The colocalization  \nof both molecules, EGFR and CD133, may also contribute to this activity, as has been previously \ndemonstrated in in vitro  studies.  \nThe combination of nimotuzumab and radiation also inhibited tumor  growth in athymic mice \nimplanted with H292 and Ma -1 xenografts which express high or moderate levels of EGFR.  This \nstudy also demonstrated that nimotuzumab increased the radiosensitivity of H292 and Ma -1 in \nvivo. In addition, the combination of CPT -11 plus nimotuzumab showed greater inhibition of \ntumor  growth in athymic mice implanted with gastric GCIY xenografts compared to single agent \nadministration. Most recently , in vivo  studies on whic h nimotuzumab was used as monotherapy or \nin combination with paclitaxel or carboplatin on NCI -H292 human lung mucoepidermoid \ncarcinoma cell line xenografted into nude mice has shown antitumor effect when nimotuzumab \nwas used as monotherapy and this antitum or effect was significantly increased with the \ncombination with paclitaxel or carboplatin.  \nAltogether, these  data suggest that nimotuzumab has a mechanism of action similar to that of \nother  existing monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGFR such as cetuximab, panitumumab \nand matuzumab.  \n \n4.3 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution.  \n \nSingle -dose pharmacokinetic studies were performed in mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys and \nbaboons using 99mTc, 125I, 188Re or ELISA assay to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters for \nnimotuzumab [e.g., half -life, area -under -the-curve (AUC), volume of distribution, clearances, \netc.].  Biodistribution studies in xenograft mice injected with human cell lines (H -125 lung \nadenocarcinoma, U -87 human glioblastoma multiforme, A431 human vulvar epidermoid \ncarcinoma, MDA -MB-468 human breast carcinoma cell lines) were  performed to evaluate the \nability of nimotuzumab to bind to human tumor s in vivo .  Single dose  biodistribution studies were \nalso carried out using 99mTc, 188Re or 64Cu in normal mice, rats, and baboons. A summary of the \npharmacokinetic and biodistribution study results is provided in Appendix A, Table A - 4. \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of nimotuzumab was evaluated in nine (9) studies conducted in \nmice, rats, rabbits, monkeys, and baboons.  \nIn Balb /c mice, the blood radioactivity -time curve was best -fit to a monoexponentially  equation \nwith a half -life (T ½) of 14.27 h.  \nIn Crl:BALB /c-nu mice, using intravenous (i.v .) and intraperitoneal (i.p .) administration, for \nthe i.v . administration values of AUC 0-last increased with increase of the dose ( Appendix A, Table \nA-4) and for the i.p . administration values of AUC 0-last also increased with increase of the dose with \na serum concentration of DE -766 Cmax being reached between 8 and 24 h after administration \nand the values increased in proportion to the increase of the dose ( Appendix A, Table A -4). \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 19 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         In Wistar rats, serum disappearance curves were best fit by a two -compartment model having \na mean distribution half -life (T 1/2) of 0.25 hours and a mean elimination half -life (T 1/2) of 13.89 \nhours and  mean systemic clearance of 5.7 mL/h/kg.  \nIn Crl:CD(SD) rats, serum disappearance curves were best fit by a non -compartment model \nhaving a mean half -life (T 1/2) of (135 ± 12) h, (157 ± 24) h and (140 ± 9) h and a mean systemic \nclearance CL of (0.518 ± 0.044) mL/h/kg, (0.535 ± 0.016) mL/h/kg and (0.581 ± 0.040) mL/h/kg \nfor the doses of 1.14 mg/kg, 5.7 mg/kg and 26.0 mg/kg respectively.  \nIn rabbits, as the dose level increased, clearance decreased and half -life increased, so that total \nserum exposure to nimotuzumab (AUC) increased more than proportionally with dose level.  \nIn green monkeys, nimotuzumab exhibited a mean elimination half -life ranging from 7 to 8 \ndays, and mean clearance of 13 mL/day/kg.  \nIn a single dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, nimotuzumab exhibited a mean \nelimination half-life ranging from 39.81 h (for a dose level of 5.71 mg/kg representing 1x the \nhuman therapeutic dose of 400mg) to 88.75 h (for a dose level of 50.00 mg/kg represented 8.75 \ntimes the human therapeutic dose of 400 mg). The mean systemic clearance was 0.50 mL/h/k g and \n0.22 mL/h/kg respectively for the 2 dose levels.  \nPharmacokinetic parameters in cynomolgus monkeys were also assessed in a repeated dose \ntoxicology study where monkeys received 5.71, 28.55 or 50.00 mg/kg of nimotuzumab via a 1 -\nhour infusion once a week for 26 weeks.  \n \n• The mean maximum concentration ranged between 124.50 g/mL and 2718.27 g/mL \nin the dose range of 5.71 to 50.00 mg/kg/week administered for 26 weeks.  Dose -\nnormalized C max ranged between 21.80 kg· g/mL/mg to 55.75 kg· g/mL/mg.  \n• The mean area under the curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration \n(AUC 0-t) ranged between 5886.69 g·h/mL and 196332.77 g·h/mL in the dose range \nof 5.71 to 50.00 mg/kg/week administered 26 weeks.  The dose -normalized AUC 0-t, \nranged from 1030.94 kg· g·h/mL/mg to 3926.66 kg· g·h/mL/mg.  \n• The dose -normalized C max and AUCs indicate a more than proportional increase in \nexposure with increase in dose from 5.71 to 50.00 mg/kg/week.  The data suggest that \nthis more than proportional increase is independent of gender or dosing week.  \n• The mean terminal elimination half -life ranged from 40.24 h to 184.26 h and increased \nas dose increased.  \n \nIn baboons, radiolabeled nimotuzumab was cleared from the circulation with biexponential \nkinetics having a mean distribution half -life (T 1/2) of 3.63 h and a mean elimination half -life \n(T1/2) of 42.19 h. The half -lives obtained in this study are also consistent with previous clearance \nstudies with other humanized monoclonal antibodies in other animal models conducted over a \ncomparable time scale which measured half -lives between 0.1 and 104 h  (Haunschild 1995, \nBaselga 1994, Khetarpal 1995, Murthy 1987, Ta kahashi 1993, Dadparvar 1994, Steiner 1995).  \nSix non-clinical  studies examining the biodistribution of nimotuzumab have been conducted in \nmice, rats, and baboons.  \nIn athymic nude mice bearing tumor  xenografts, the biodistribution data shows a higher uptake \nof radioactivity into the tumor . Tumor  uptake data suggested that there is a threshold number of \nEGFR per cell above which nimotuzumab (with a binding affinity in the order of 10-8 M) will bind \ntumor  cells in vivo  and will accumulate in the xenografted tumor s (as seen in the H -125, A431 and \nMDA -MB-468 cell lines), and below which the antibody will not bind or accumulate in the \nxenografted tumor s (as seen with the U -87 cell line). Significant accumulation of the radioactivity \nwas found in the kidneys suggesting compound clearance via the urinary route. The low \naccumulation of radioactivity in the liver and small intestine of athymic nude mice suggests that \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 20 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         the main route of elimination for this radiopharmaceutical is not via the hepatobiliary -intestine \nroute.  \nAn additional study in athymic nude mice bearing A431 tumor  xenografts showed a significant \nincrease in antibody concentration from 4 to 24 h post -injection of 64Cu-labeled nimotuzumab. \nOther organs with notable distribution of the antibody included liver and kidney.  \nIn BALB /c mice, significant accumulation occurred in the blood, liver, kidney, small intestines \nand large intestines at one-hour post-administration and remained visible at 72 h post -injection.  \nIn Wistar rats, localization of the radioactivity was significant in the kidney.  Accumulation of \nradiolabeled nimotuzumab was also observed in the liver, intestines, lung and spleen.   \nIn baboons, after administration of 188Re-labeled nimotuzumab, the liver, heart, kidneys, urinary \nbladder and gastrointestinal tract were visible immediately and remained visible through 48 h post -\ninjection. The results indicated that the liver was the major organ of excretion for radiolabeled \nnimotuzumab in the baboon.  \n \n4.4 Nonclinical Toxicology . \n \nThe safety of nimotuzumab has been evaluated in two single -dose intravenous studies in rats \n(Studies #96/31 and #AcMU0499), a single dose intravenous study in cynomolgus monkeys \n(Study # ITR 30143), three 14 -day repeat -dose intravenous toxicity studies in rats (Studies \n#CIMYM -003-TS , #AcMU0599 and #209517), a 4-week repeat -dose intravenous toxicity study \nin rats ( Study# B100433), two 14 -day repeat -dose intravenous toxicity studies in green monkeys \n(Studies #R3AD0997 and #AR3R0101), two 26 -week repeat -dose intravenous toxicity studies in \nmonkeys (Study #PR3M0403 - green monkeys and Study # ITR 30103 – cynomolgus monkeys), \na local tolerance study in rabbits (#97/26) and an in vitro  cardiotoxicity study in Human Embryonic \nKidney (HEK) cells (Study # IPST 800408 -1). Results are provided in Appendix A, Table A - 5, \nTable A - 6, Table A - 7 and Table A -8. \nNimotuzumab was well tolerated in both rats and monkeys, producing minimal adverse effects \nwhen given to either species daily for up to 2 weeks or to monkeys weekly for 26 weeks.  This \nsafety profile compares favorably to that of approved monoclonal antibo dy products, including \ncetuximab and panitumumab, which also target EGFR.  \n \n5 EFFECTS IN HUMANS . \n \nNimotuzumab is an intravenously administered human monoclonal antibody directed against \nEGFR. EGFR is known to be overexpressed on many human tumor s and has been demonstrated \nto be a key driver of uncontrolled proliferation of tumor  cells in vitro  and in vivo . \nAs of October 2025 , 51 clinical trials have been completed with nimotuzumab in several \ncancer indications as summarized in Table 2 . Data is presented on 5653  patients in 51 of these \ncompleted trials ( 3823  patients recruiting to nimotuzumab arm and 1830  patients  to the control \narm). Efficacy results are provided by study ( Sections 5.1, through 5. 52) and an overall summary \nof safety is provided in Section 5.55. A listing of ong oing studies is provided in Table 3.  \nIn the completed trials, nimotuzumab was given either as a single agent or in combination \nwith chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The primary objectives of these studies were to establish \nthe safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and immunogeni c profiles of \nnimotuzumab.  Adult patients were treated with a range of doses from 50 mg to 1200 mg, either \nas a single dose or as multiple sequential doses, while pediatric patients were dosed according to \nbody surface area (150 mg/m2). \nSerum pharmacokinetic and biodistribution data for nimotuzumab in patients with cancer have \nbeen obtained across multiple clinical studies ( Section 5. 53). Interpretation of the available data \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 21 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         suggests that nimotuzumab clearance was saturable with increasing doses, a finding used indirectly \nto support tumor  EGF receptor saturation and Phase II dose selection.  \nImmunogenic data for nimotuzumab in cancer patients has been obtained in eight clinical \nstudies ( Section 5.54). \n \nTable 2: Completed Clinical Trials with Nimotuzumab.  \nStudy Number  \n(Location)  Indication  Phase  Dose of

Patients were divided into 4 cohorts, and \neach received 10 weekly intravenous infusions of 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg o f nimotuzumab over \na period of 30 minutes. Concurrently, patients were administered four 21 -day cycles of \ndoxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2). This study was conducted in one \ninvestigation site in Cuba and was initiated in October 2005 and completed in November 2006.  \nThirteen patients, all female [mean age 47 years (range 30 to 63)] were enrolled in the study \nand treated with nimotuzumab. Following administration of the 10 weekly doses of nimotuzumab \nin combination with chemotherapy, 101 adverse events were reported in  the 13 patients enrolled \nin this study. Of the 95 AEs for which causality was reported, 60 were considered at least possibly \nrelated to study treatment. The most frequently reported AEs related to study treatment included \nfacial erythema (8 subjects; 62%) , mucositis (3 subjects; 23%), nausea (2 subjects; 15%), \nheadache (2 subjects; 15%) and pain at injection site (2 subjects; 15%). A summary of related \nadverse events is provided in Appendix B , Table B -1. The events were primarily mild to \nmoderate in severity and were all considered reversible. In the study, there were 2 SAEs in 2 \npatients. None of the serious adverse events were considered by the investigators to be related to \nnimotuzumab treatment.  \n \n5.2 Study No. YMB -1000 -015 (completed, Colorectal) . \n \nA two -cohort, open -label, multi -center Phase II trial was performed to evaluate the safety and \nefficacy of nimotuzumab in patients with irinotecan -refractory metastatic colorectal cancer in \ntwo dosing regimens: 400 mg weekly and 400 mg every 2 weeks.  The primary objective was the \nassessment of objective response rate of nimotuzumab in combination with irinotecan. Secondary \nobjectives included progression -free survival  (PFS) , time to tumor  progression  (TTP) , overall \nsurvival (OS), and pharmacokinetics. Pati ents were treated with 400 mg nimotuzumab on a \nweekly basis for 12 weeks, followed by 400 mg nimotuzumab every 2 weeks. Concurrently, \npatients receive  irinotecan at the same dose and schedule as the patient’s last irinotecan regimen. \nDue to the lower than anticipated response rate, this study was terminated after the completion \nof the first cohort (400 mg weekly in combination with irinotecan) and did n ot enroll any patients \ninto the second cohort (400 mg every 2 weeks in combination with irinotecan). This trial was  \nconducted in Canada in 15 investigation sites and was  initiated in July 2007 and completed in \nAugust 2008.   \nA total of 61 patients (29 males/32 females) with a mean age of 60.1 years (range 23 to 83) \nwere recruited for treatment.  All patients were eligible for efficacy and safety analysis.  \nAll 61 subjects (100%) experienced at least one AE during  the study.  The most reported  AEs \nwere fatigue (37 subjects; 61 %), nausea (32 subjects; 52 %), diarrhea (28 subjects; 46 %), \nalopecia (26 subjects; 43 %), anorexia (25 subjects; 41 %) and constipation (25 subjects; 41 %). \nForty -four (44; 72 %) patients had at least one AE considered to be related to study drug.  The \nmost common AEs (≥15 % of patients) related to study drug were  fatigue (21 subjects; 34 %), \ndermatitis (acneiform), (12 subjects; 21 %) , diarrhea, (11 subjects; 18 %), nausea (10 subjects; \n16 %), and exfoliative rash (9 subjects; 15 %).  A listing of related AEs by grade is shown in \nAppendix B , Table  B-2. Nine patients were withdrawn from the study early due to AEs. None \nof the AEs leading to withdrawal were  related to study drug.   \nIn the study, there were 30 serious adverse events in 20 subjects. Out of 30 SAEs, there were \n2 SAEs in 2 patients (3.28%) that were  related to the study drug. Possibly related SAEs included \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 28 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         one event of fatigue and one event of deep vein thrombosis. A listing of related SAEs is provided \nin Appendix C, Table C -1   \nThere were 4 SAEs that lead to subject death: dyspnea (Subject 03 -010), metastatic neoplasm \n(Subject 08 -001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (Subject 13 -004), and disease progression \n(Subject 15 -007). These 4 SAEs which resulted in death were consider ed unrelated to study drug.  \nThe combination of irinotecan and nimotuzumab was assessed in this population to determine \nif the overall response rate would provide a clinical benefit. In the intent -to-treat (ITT) \npopulation, an objective response rate of 1.6 % was observed (1 PR) and c linical benefit rate was \nshown to be 26 % (1 PR and 15 SD). Progression -free survival and time to tumor  progression \nwere identical, with a range of 0.8 to 9.5 months and a median of 2.3 months. Overall survival \nranged from 1.6 to 14.2 months and had a medi an value of 6.1 months.  \nThis study confirms the improved safety and tolerability of nimotuzumab, with no subjects \nexperiencing severe rash reactions and no subjects requiring dose reductions, dose interruptions \nor withdrawals due to nimotuzumab  treatment.  Irinotecan was administered concurrently and \nwas provided in 3 different dosing schedules and dose levels to match administration schedules \nalready provided to each subject. This regimen was also well tolerated with a safety profile that \nwas c onsistent with known events.  Althou gh the overall response rate was lower than expected \nin this study, there remained 11 % of subjects with stable disease at study termination.  \n \n5.3 Study No. IIC RD EC -134 (completed, Colorectal) . \n \nThis was an open -label, non -randomized, non -controlled, dose finding, pharmacokinetic, \nsingle -center, phase I trial to evaluate the safety of single -agent nimotuzumab in patients with \nlocally advanced and/or metastatic CRC who have clinical failure after r eceiving at least one \noxaliplatin CT -regimen. Every patient was administered weekly 200, 400, 800, or 1200 mg \nnimotuzumab infusion for seven weeks and then maintenance dose of every 2 weeks, until 2 \nyears or significant toxicity. Primary endpoint was to ev aluate the safety of nimotuzumab up to \n1200 mg in a long-lasting  schedule. Secondary endpoints included the pharmacokinetic profile \nof nimotuzumab for each dose level and the preliminary efficacy of the monotherapy assessing \na comparison with historical  control . \nThis study was initiated in May 2011 and completed in July 2015. Twenty -two patients were \nincluded in the study. Two patients  assigned one each to the 200 and 1200 mg nimotuzumab who \nearly abandoned the study, were judged to have not achieved endpoints  and were then replaced. \nTwenty patients were included in the analysis of clinical activity, having received the scheduled \ninduction treatment (at least 7 doses).  \nSafety analysis was based on 21 subjects who received at least one dose of nimotuzumab. No \ntreatment -related serious or severe adverse events were reported for doses up to 1200 mg. All \nsubjects experienced at least one adverse event during the study, but t here was no evidence of a \nrelationship between the dose and the intensity, duration or frequency of these adverse events. \nOf all the 108 AEs reported, 9 events (8.3%) in 4 patients (19%) were  related to the study drug. \nThe most common one was rash (3.7% of  reported AEs), observed in 2 patients (9.5%) at 200 \nand 800 mg levels. In general, most AE were mild to moderate (96.3%), except for 4 no \ntreatment -related severe adverse events (3.7%) in 3 patients at 200 and 800 mg levels.  \nOut of 20 evaluable patients, one (400 mg level) displayed the best  response of partial \nresponse (PR), while 5 (one in 200mg, 2 in 400mg and one in 1200mg) exhibited stable disease \n(SD) and 14 progressed (PD). The median overall survival of patients administered 200, 400, \n800, or 1200 mg nimotuzumab were 28.17, 55.50, 22. 17 or 29.97 months, respectively, \ncomparing favorably with those of historical controls in this setting. Although the study was too \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 29 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         small to be statistically significant, evidence suggests  that patients benefit most from 400 mg \ndose.  \n \n5.4 Study No. DE766 -A-J102 (completed, esophageal) . \n \nThis was a Phase 1, open label , escalating dose, multicenter study in patients with locally \nadvanced esophageal cancer conducted in Japan and sponsored by Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd. The \nobjective of this study was to evaluate the safety of DE -766 in combination with cisplatin, \nfluorouraci l and radiation therapy in patients with stage II, III (excluding T4), or IV (M1 lymph \nnode involvement, excluding  T4) esophageal cancer. This study was conducted in 7 investigation \nsites in Japan and was initiated in December  2010 and completed in April 2015.  \nNimotuzumab was administered  at 200 mg (Level 1) or 400 mg (Level 2) once weekly as an \ni.v. infusion from d1 of Course 1 to the end of Course 2. Each course consisted of 4 weeks. \nCisplatin was administered at a dose of 75 mg/m2 as an i.v . infusion on d1 of each course, \nfollowed by 4 -weeks rest period. 5 -FU was administered  at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 as a continuous \ni.v. infusion for 4 consecutive days from d1 of each course. Radiotherapy was given at a dose of \n1.8 Gy once daily for 5 days a week for 6 weeks fo r a total of 50.4 Gy in 30 fractions.  \nThe primary endpoint of the study was to determine dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) and \nmaximum -tolerated dose (MTD) of DE -766 in combination with chemoradiotherapy . The \nsecondary endpoints  were PK, antitumor effect (complete response rate, PFS and OS rates at 1 -\nyear, 2 -year and 3 -year), safety, immunogenicity (HAHA response) and exploratory efficacy -\nrelated biomarkers (EGFR expression, KRAS, expression of proteins or genes in tumors, \nexpres sion of proteins in serum and analysis of FcγR polymorphisms in blood -derived DNA).  \nA total of 10 patients (7 males and 3 females) with mean age 62.0 years (range 51 to 71 years) \nwere included on the study. All 10 patients included in the study received at least one dose of the \nstudy drug and were included in the safety analysis set. DLTs were evaluated during the \nchemoradiation period and were analyzed in 9 subjects included in the MTD analysis set. One \nsubject withdrew from the study  treatment after receiving only the first dose of DE -766 only, \nwithout receiving chemoradiotherapy, which precluded appropriate evaluation of safety , and this \nsubject was accordingly excluded from the MTD analysis set.  \nThe DLT, the primary endpoint, was analyzed in 9 subjects included in the MTD analysis set, \nand the MTD was estimated based on the results of DLT evaluation. At the dosage Level 1 (200 \nmg) there were 7 patients  (77.7 %) with non -DLT and 2 subjects (22.2 %) with DLT. In the MTD \nanalysis set, a total of 2 patients  who experienced  one patient infection and the other renal \ndisorder under treatment of 200 mg (Level 1) were considered to have DLTs. The frequency of \nDLTs was 22.2 % (2/9 patients). The frequency of  DLTs at 200 mg (Level 1) satisfied the criteria \nfor dose increase specified in the protocol and the MTD was estimated to be at least 200 mg; \nhowever, the dose of nimotuzumab was not increased to 400 mg (Level 2).  \nAll patients experienced at least one treatment -emergent adverse event. A total of 341 \ntreatment -emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported in 10 patients. Of the 341 AEs, 123 AEs \nwere not related and 218 AEs (63.9 %) in 10 patients (100 %) were reported to be related to the \nstudy drug. The most common study -drug related AEs (> 3 patients, 30.0 %) were lymphocyte \ncount decreased (8 subjects, 80.0 %), neutrophil count decreased (8 subjects, 80.0 %), white \nblood cell count decreased (8 subjects, 80.0 %), pla telet count decreased (7 subjects, 70.0 %), \nanemia (7 subjects, 70.0 %), hypoalbuminemia  (6 subjects, 60.0 %), hyponatremia  (5 subjects, \n50.0 %), weight loss (5 subjects, 50.0 %), radiation esophagitis  (5 subjects, 50.0 %), protein total \ndecreased (4 subjects, 40.0 %), decreased appetite (4 subjects, 40.0 %), fatigue (4 subjects, 40.0 \n%), nausea (4 subjects, 40.0 %), and radiation pneumonitis (3 subject, 30.0 %). A listing of \ntreatment -related adverse e vents is provided in Appendix B, Table B -4.  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 30 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         There was a total of 8 serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in 6 patients (60.0 %). Of the 8 \nSAEs, there were 6 SAEs reported in 4 patients (40.0 %) that were  related to the study drug. Most \ncommon SAEs reported to be related to study drug were, gastric cancer (1 patient, 10.0 %), herpes \nzoster (1 patient, 10.0 %), radiation esophagitis  (1 patient, 10.0 %) and anaphylactic reaction, \nlaryngeal edema  and dyspnea reported in the same patient (10.0 %). A listing of treatment -related \nSAEs is provided in Append ix C, Table C -1. \nOne subject had bile duct cancer and died during this study; however, this event was \nconsidered secondary cancer that occurred incidentally and  was assessed to be unrelated to the \nstudy treatment.  \nThere were 8 subjects that were evaluable for response in the Per Protocol Set (PPS). There \nwere 4 CR (50.0 %) (4 /8 patients) and 1 non -CR (12.5 %) (1/8 patients) and 3 progressive disease \n(37.5 %). On the ITT population 1 -year and 3 -year survival rates [ 95 % CI] were 80.0 % [40.9, \n94.6 %] and 40.0 % [12.3, 67.0 %], respectively.  \n \n5.5 Study No. II RD EC -075 (completed, Esophageal Cancer) . \n \nThis was a phase II, open label , controlled, randomized and multicenter clinical trial to \nevaluate the anti -tumo r effect of monoclonal antibody nimotuzumab combined with radiation \ntherapy and chemotherapy for the treatment of malignant, non -resectable, esophageal tumor s.  \nPatients were recruited into 2 cohorts: group I was treated for six weeks with 200 mg \nnimotuzumab, for five weeks with radiation therapy and for 14 weeks with chemotherapy (5 -FU \n750 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2).  Group II was treated with  radiotherapy for five weeks and \nwith chemotherapy for 14 weeks (cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and 5 -FU 750 mg/m2). The primary \nobjective was to assess objective response rate. Secondary objectives included evaluation of \nsafety, quality of life and immunogenicity. The study was conducted in 6 investigation sites and \nwas initiated in December 2005 and was completed in January 2010.  \nA total of 63 patients were enrolled in the study.  Thirty -three (33) patients (26 males and 7 \nfemales) with a mean age of 58.53 years were randomized to the nimotuzumab group and 30 \npatients (25 males and 5 females) with a mean age of 58.9 years were rand omized to the control \ngroup.  \nThe most common adverse events related to nimotuzumab were headache, phlebitis and pain \nwhen swallowing (2 events each).  See Appendix B, Table B -5 for a listing of the related adverse \nevents with severities. There were no serious adverse events reported in the study and no deaths \nwere related to nimotuzumab.  \nThe results for the objective response were 47.8 % and 15.4 %, for the nimotuzumab and \ncontrol groups, respectively (p=0.014).  Regarding clinical benefit, the values were 60.9 % versus \n26.9 % in favor  of the group treated with nimotuzumab plus radiation -chemotherapy (p=0.017).  \nThere were no significant differences between the groups with respect to survival; the median \nwas 8.1 months for the nimotuzumab group vs. 2.97 months for the radiation -chemothe rapy \ngroup.  \n \n5.6 Study No. EF024 -201 (completed, Esophageal Cancer) . \n \nThis was a phase II, open label , controlled, randomized and multicenter clinical trial \nconducted in 10 investigation sites in Brazil and sponsored by Eurofarma Laboratorios to \nevaluate the anti -tumor  effect of monoclonal antibody nimotuzumab combined with radiation \ntherapy and chemotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced and inoperable esophageal \ntumor s with no previous treatment of the disease.  Patients were recruited into 2 cohorts: Control \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 31 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         arm, patients received chemotherapy including cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on d1) and 5 -FU (1000 \nmg/m2 from d1 -4), every four (4) weeks for 4 cycles and radiotherapy 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of \n1.8 Gy/day for 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. In the experimental arm, patients received the same \nchemotherapy and radiotherapy regimen as the control arm which was combined  with \nnimotuzumab 200 mg intravenously once a week for 13 weeks during chemotherapy and for \nanother  13 weeks after completion of chemotherapy.  \nThe primary objective was to assess the endoscopic complete response rate (ECRR) calculated \nbased on DENDRIX algorithm. Secondary objectives included evaluation of overall survival, \ntime to progression, clinical complete response (CCR) rate, safety, qualit y of life and \nimmunogenicity. The study was initiated in February 2009 and was completed in August 2011.  \nA total of 107 patients were enrolled in the study. Fifty -three (53) patients (44 males and 9 \nfemales) with a mean age of 59.9 years were randomized to the nimotuzumab group and 54 \npatients (44 males and 10 females) with a mean age of 58.5 years were rando mized to the control \ngroup.  \nIn the safety data set, there were (N=103) patients;  of them 53 patients were from the treatment \narm and 50 patients from the control that received the drug treatment. A total of 1919 adverse \nevents were reported, 1044 on the nimotuzumab arm and 875 in the control arm. The most \ncommon adverse events related  to nimotuzumab were anemia (8 subjects, 15.1 %), fatigue (8 \nsubjects, 15.1 %), nausea (9 subjects, 16.9 %), leukopenia (8 subjects, 15.1 %), lymphopenia (8 \nsubjects, 15.1 %), neutropenia (9 subjects, 16. 9 %), stomatitis oral cavity (8 subjects, 15.1 %), \nvomiting (9 subjects, 16.9 %) and y -glutamyl transpeptidase (6 subjects, 11.3 %). See Appendix \nB, Table B -6 for a listing of the adverse events related to study drug.  \nThere was a total of 98 serious  adverse events (SAEs) reported in 54 patients, 48 SAEs from \nthe control arm reported in 26 patients (48.1 %) and 50 SAEs from nimotuzumab plus \nradiotherapy and chemotherapy arm reported in 28 patients (52.8 %). Of the 50 SAEs, reported \non the nimotuzumab arm, 13 SAEs reported in 11 patients (20.8 %) were reported to be related \nto the study drug. Most common SAEs reported to be related to study drug were anemia (2 \nsubjects, 3.70 %), febrile neutropenia (2 subjects, 3.70 %), an d pneumonitis (2 subjects, 3.70 %). \nThere were 78 patients who died during  the study. From them,  26 deaths occurred during the \nfollow -up period according to the protocol . Of these 26 deaths, 9 deaths were considered as SAE \nrelated to the study drug, 5 deaths in the control arm and 4 deaths on the experimental arm. Of \nthe 4 deaths on the nimotuzumab arm, one patient EF024 -204-0604 was considered as related to \nstudy drug. All listed treatment -related SAEs are provided in Appendix C, Table C -1. \nThe combined response endoscopic complete response rate (ECRR) and pathologic response \nrate were 53 patients out of 107 (20 patients of 54 (37.04 %) 95% CI [24.29 % – 51.26%] in the \ncontrol arm and 33 patients of 53 (62.26 %) 95 % CI 47.89 % – 75.21 %] in the nimotuzumab \narm, p =0.0157). There were 78 events out of 107 during the course of the study (43 in the control \narm and 35 in the nimotuzumab arm). For a median follow up of 14.5 months, median OS on the \ncontrol arm was 11.54 months and 15.88 months for  the nimotuzumab arm, HR = 0.6826, 95 % \nCI [0.4372, 1.0659], p = 0.0908. There were no statistical differences between the two arms.  \n \n5.7 Study No. BT -ESO -1001 (completed, Esophageal Cancer).  \n \nThis was a phase II, double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized and multicenter clinical \ntrial conducted in China and sponsored by Biotech Pharmaceuticals Ltd to evaluate the anti -\ntumoral effect, safety and toxicity of monoclonal antibody nimotuzumab com bined with \nradiation therapy and chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced \nesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Primary objectives of the study were the evaluation of \ncomplete remission rate 14 weeks after the end of the treatment and  secondary objectives \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 32 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         included the evaluation of disease -free survival and overall survival, disease free survival and \noverall survival rates, safety and QoL.  \nPatients were recruited into 2 cohorts: Experimental Arm: patients received chemotherapy \nincluding cisplatin (25 mg/m2 on infusion d1 -3) and 5 -FU (600 mg/m2 on infusion from d1 -3), \nevery four (4) weeks for 4 cycles and radiotherapy 61.2 Gy of three dimensional conformal \nradiotherapy (3DCRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in 34 fractions of 1.8 \nGy/day for 5 days a week for 6.8 weeks plus nimot uzumab 200 mg intravenously once a week \nfor 9 weeks and Control Arm: patients received the same chem otherapy and radiotherapy \nregimen as the Experimental Arm plus placebo 200 mg intravenously once a week for 9 weeks. \nThe study was initiated in April 2010 and was completed in July 2013.  \nA total of 160 patients were randomly assigned to either of the arms. Eighty  (80) patients (62 \nmales and 18 females) with a mean age of 60.08 years were randomized to the Experimental Arm \nand 80 patients (65 males and 15 females) with a mean age of 60.43 years were randomized to \nthe Control Arm. Of the 160 patients included in the study, 159 patients received at least one \ndose of nimotuzumab or placebo. From them,  80 patients were evaluable on the nimotuzumab \narm and 79 patients on the placebo -controlled ar m. \nA total of 118 (73.8 %) out of 160 patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE). Sixty \n(60) patients (75 %) on the nimotuzumab arm and 58 patients (72.5 %) on the control arm. From \nthese 118 patients, a total of 764 AEs was reported, 389 on the nim otuzumab arm and 375 on the \ncontrol arm. The most frequently reported AEs on the nimotuzumab arm, regardless of \nrelationship to the study drug, were nausea (27 subjects, 33.8 %), lymphopenia (21 subjects, 26.3 \n%), neutropenia (21 subjects, 26.3 %), cough ( 20 subjects, 25.0 %), esophagitis radiation (19 \nsubjects, 23.8 %), vomiting (19 subjects, 23.8 %), dysphagia (18 subjects, 22.5 %), and anorexia \n(16 subjects, 20.0 %). Eleven (11) patients (13.8 %) out of 80 reported 13 study drug -related \nAEs. The most com mon study -drug related AEs (> 2 patients, 2.5%) were nausea (3 subjects, \n3.75 %) and fatigue (2 subjects, 2.5 %). A listing of treatment -related adverse events is provided \nin Appendix B, Table B -7. \nTwo (2) (1.25 %) patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) during the study period, \nall of which were single events reported. One (1) patient from the nimotuzumab arm had an SAE \nconsisting in dysphagia and 1 patient from the control arm had an SAE  consisting in vomiting, \nresulting in death. The single SAE consisting of dysphagia reported on the nimotuzumab arm \nwas considered by the investigators to be related to radiotherapy treatment and not to be related \nto nimotuzumab treatment.  \nStatistically significant differences were observed between nimotuzumab and placebo groups \nin terms of the primary endpoint the completed response rate (CRR), being 26.3 % for the \nnimotuzumab arm vs 11.4 % for the placebo arm with a p = 0.017. Median overa ll survival (OS) \nwas 22.1 months for the treatment arm compared to 19.6 months for the placebo arm which was \nnot statistically significant and the survival rate at 2 years was 49 % for the treatment arm vs 39.2 \n% for the placebo arm respectively  \n \n5.8 Study No. IIC RD EC -0163 (completed, Esophageal Cancer).  \n \nThis was a Phase IV , uncontrolled, open and multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the adverse \nevents, OS and PFS, clinical response and quality of life (QoL), in patients with inoperable \ntumors of esophagus  of epithelial origin. The study was conducted in 14 investigation sites in \nCuba and was initiated in July 2016 and concluded in July 2019.  \nIn this study patients received nimotuzumab 200 mg i.v . infusion once a week for 6 weeks \nand subsequently every 2 weeks until non -tolerable toxicity or withdrawal from study . If the \npatient was medically fit for radiotherapy concurrently received 50.4 Gy in no more than 30 \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 33 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         sessions, 1.8 Gy once a day for 5 days a week from the 2nd to the 7th week. If the patient was \nmedically fit for chemotherapy concomitantly, considering 2 strata: the first formed by new -\ndiagnosis patients, who received the chemotherapy of 1st line from the 2nd week, every 28 days \n(4 weeks) and for 4 cycles. chemotherapy comprised cisplatin (CDDP), 75 -100 mg/m2, day 1, \nand 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), 750 -1000 mg/m2 in continuous infusion, days 1 -4 of the week. At 18 \nweeks the clinical antitumor response was eval uated. In patients with partial response, stable \ndisease or progression, the 2nd line of chemotherapy was also indicated as is established in the \ntreatment standards and considering the availability in each institution. In the second stratum \nwere included patients with disease recurrence at the time of inclusion. They received treatment \nwith nimotuzumab, concomitant with 2nd line chemotherapy as is established in the treatment \nstandards and considering the availability of cytostatic  in each institution. If a subsequent \nimaging evaluation detected disease progression, another 2nd line chemotherapy was indicated .  \nTwo hundred and seve nty-six (276) patients were enrolled in this study  and 111 were \nevaluable for the analysis, of them 100 newly diagnosed and 11 recurrent patients. Of the 100 \nnewly diagnosed patients, 45 patients with nimotuzumab plus radiotherapy and chemotherapy, \n20 patients with nimotuzumab plus chemotherapy, 14 patients with nimotuzumab plus \nradiotherapy, and 21 patients with nimotuzumab monotherapy. Seventy -one (7 1) newly \ndiagnosed patients received six or more doses of nimotuzumab . Of them, 39 (54. 9%) received \nnimotuzumab plus radiotherapy and chemotherapy . Of the 11 recurrent patients, 5 patients with \nnimotuzumab plus chemotherapy and 6 patients with nimotuzumab monotherapy.  Eight (8) \nrecurrent patients received six or more doses of nimotuzumab. Out of 111 patients included in \nthe study , 100 were evaluable for safety and response, 92 newly diagnosed patients and 8 \nrecurrent patients.  The main causes of early dropout were death (28.04%), rapid worsening of \nthe performan ce status (27.10%) and consent withdrawal (21.50%).  \nIn the 100 patients , there were 61 patients who experienced at least one adverse event (AE). \nThere was a total of 229 AEs reported in 61 patients (61%) . Of 229 AEs reported, 14 AEs that \n(6.1 %) that occurred in 7 patients (7%) were considered related to the study drug. The most \nfrequent related AEs were diarrhea, chills and tremors . A listing of treatment -related adverse \nevents is provided in Appendix B, Table B -8. \nThere was a total of 39 s erious AEs (SAEs) reported in 27 patients (27%). Of the 39 SAEs \nreported during the study period, 39 SAEs related to treatment occurred  in 27 patients (27%), of \nthese only 3 SAEs related to nimotuzumab  occurred in 2 patients (2%) . A listing of related SAEs \nis presented in Appendix C, Table C -1.  \nNewly diagnosed patients who received nimotuzumab concurrent with chemotherapy and \nradiotherapy, reached a median OS of 12.2 months (95% CI, 6.9 -17.5), 12 -months OS rate of \n51.0%, 24-months OS rates of 17.0%, median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI, 6.2 -9.5) and 12 - \nand 24 -months PFS rates of 39.3% and 11.2% respectively.  Newly diagnosed patients who \nreceived nimotuzumab plus chemotherapy  reached a median OS of 6.8 months (95% CI, 3.8 -\n9.8), the 12 -months OS rates of 18.8%, and 12 -month  PFS rates of 7.5%. Patients  treated with \nnimotuzumab plus radiotherapy and nimotuzumab monotherapy did not reach a 12 -month OS \nrate. \nAn evolution of the general state of health was obtained from the beginning of treatment until \nmonth 12, with a significant reduction in the appearance of nausea (p=0.009), insomnia (p=0.04), \nconstipation (p=0.04), eating difficulties (p=0.0006) and chokin g when swallowing (p=0.0001), \nbut increase in dysphagia (p=0.02).  \n \n5.9 Study No. BT-ESO -0901 (completed, Esophageal Cancer).  \n \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 34 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         This was  a Phase I , single -center clinical trial  to evaluate the tolerability and short -term effects \nof increasing doses of nimotuzumab ( Taixinsheng ) injection combined with radiotherapy and \nchemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer . The study was conducted \nin one investigation site in China and was initiated in July 2009 and concluded in July 2010.  \nAll patients in the study receive d nimotuzumab intravenous infusion, while receiving standard \ncombined radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment . Nim otuzumab injection  was administered \nonce a week for 6 weeks  at three different dosages: 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg. Chemotherapy \nregimen consisted of cisplatin + 5 -Fu. Cisplatin (DDP) 25 mg/m2 /day, intravenous infusion on \ndays 1 – 3; 5-Fu 600 mg/m2 /day, continuous intravenous infusion on days 1 – 3, for a total course \nof chemotherapy at 1, 5, 9 and 13 weeks; rad iation therapy regimen consisted of 1.8 Gy/day, on \ndays 1 – 5, every week, 34 times in total, total dose of 61.2 Gy.  \nAt the end of the study, a total of 11 patients were enrolled, and all recruited patients \ncompleted nimotuzumab treatment. One patient from the 200 mg dose group withdrew the study \ndue to withdrawal of the informed consent and one patient from the 400 mg d ose group was lost \nto follow -up.  \nExcept for the patient who voluntarily requested to withdraw from the trial in the 5th week of \nmedication, the remaining 10 patients completed nimotuzumab 6 as per the protocol . Therefore, \nno patients discontinued treatment due to treatment -related adverse events, and no patients \nexperienced protocol violations.  Due to the patient withdrawal and loss of follow -up, 10 cases \nwere evaluable at 7 weeks, with a response rate of 60.0%, and a disease control rate of 100%; 8 \ncases were evaluable at 11 weeks, with a n ORR of 75.0% and a DCR of 100%.  \nSafety data collected in this study include serious adverse events, early withdrawal , reported \nadverse events and investigator's manual inconsistent description of nimotuzumab -related \nadverse events and nimotuzumab -related rash . \nTreatment -related a dverse events occurred in all patients. Among the adverse events, \nleukopenia (11 cases), neutrophil decrease (6 cases), vomiting (5 cases), and fever (5 cases) were \nthe most common. Most adverse events were graded 1 – 2, according to CTCAE3.0. Only 2 cases  \nof leukocyte decrease were classified as grade 3. One of the cases with leukocyte decrease \noccurred at week 9, when the patient had finished nimotuzumab treatment. After 3 weeks of \ntreatment, it was considered that the event was caused by chemotherapy.  A listing of treatment -\nrelated adverse events is provided in Appendix B, Table B -9. \nAccording to the investigator s, the common adverse events that are or may be related to \nnimotuzumab include leukopenia (7  cases), vomiting (5 cases), fever (5 cases). Most of them \nwere classified as grade 1 – 2. Only one grade 3 leukopenia adverse event was classified as \nrelated or possibly related to nimotuzumab.  None of grade 3 adverse events were DLT.  \nNo serious adverse events were observed, and no participants withdrew from the study due to \nadverse events. During the study period  no death occurred. No DLT occurred during the study. \nAll the three doses evaluated were well tolerated, therefore, no maximum tolerated dose was \nfound in this study.  \nIn conclusion, nimotuzumab combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy failed to reach \nthe maximum tolerated dose in the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer. Low (100 \nmg), medium (200 mg) and high doses (400 mg) were well tolerated. No serious adverse events \nor unexpected adverse events occurred.     \n \n \n5.10 Study No. DE766 -A-J201/08 -TH-8201 (completed, Gastric).  \n \nThis was an open -label, multicenter, Japan and Korea collaborative, randomized, 2 -arm phase \nII clinical study in patients with advanced or recurrent gastric cancer refractory to 5 -fluorouracil -\nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 35 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         containing regimens. The primary endpoint was PFS, and secondary endpoints were safety, \nefficacy including OS, pharmacokinetics profile, immunogenicity and exploratory biomarker \nanalysis. This study was initiated in September 2008 and completed in July 201 4, and it was \nconducted in a collaborative work in 10 investigation sites in Japan and 6 in South Korea . \nA total of 83 patients were enrolled in the study and were divided into 2 groups comprised of \nnimotuzumab plus irinotecan (n=40), or irinotecan alone (n=43). The study drug was not \nadministered to one patient in the irinotecan alone group because the patie nt was found to be \nineligible after randomization. Nimotuzumab treatment consisted of a 400 mg dose of \nnimotuzumab administered once a week concomitantly with irinotecan, which consisted of 150 \nmg/m2 administered once every two weeks. The treatment continu ed until disease progression \nor unacceptable adverse events . \nIn the safety data set (N=82), 42 patients from Irinotecan Arm and 40 patients from Irinotecan \nplus nimotuzumab Arm  were analyzed . The most common treatment -related adverse events (>50 \n% of patients) in the nimotuzumab plus irinotecan group were neutropenia (72.5 %), nausea (60.0 \n%), diarrhea  (57.5 %), alopecia (57.5 %), decreased appetite (55.0 %), fatigue (50.0 %), and \nleukopenia (50.0 %). The incidence of treatment -related adverse events  was not higher in the \nirinotecan plus nimotuzumab combination thera py than in irinotecan  monotherapy. A listing of \ntreatment -related adverse events is provided in Appendix B, Table B -10. \nThere were 49 SAEs, 24 SAEs reported in 17 patients (40.5%) of the irinotecan arm and 25 \nSAEs reported in 15 patients (37.5%) of the irinotecan plus nimotuzumab arm. Out of 25 SAEs \nreported on the irinotecan plus nimotuzumab arm, 16 SAEs reported in 10 pat ients (25 %) were \nrelated to the study drug. The most common SAEs (> 2 patients, 5%) related to study drug were  \nvomiting (3 subjects, 7.5 %), asthenia (2 subjects, 5.0 %) and pneumonia (2 subjects, 5.0 %). \nTwo (2) patients in the nimotuzumab plus irinoteca n arm died due to pneumonia, and these events \nwere considered to be related to treatment. All patients with pneumonia were evaluated by an \nindependent data monitoring committee as to whether these events were interstitial pneumonia \nand no apparent intersti tial pneumonia was found in any patient with pneumonia. A listing of \ntreatment -related SAEs is provided in Appendix C, Table C -1. \nIn the full analysis set population (N=82), median progression free survival [95 % CI], \nassessed at 6 months follow up period from last patient in, was 73 days [55, 112] in the \nnimotuzumab plus irinotecan group and 85 days [37, 93] in the irinotecan alone group, (Hazard \nratio [95 % CI], 0.909 [0.542, 1.523], p= 0.7174). The median overall survival [95 % CI], \nassessed at 18 months’  follow -up period from last patient in was 250.5 days [171, 306] in the \nnimotuzumab plus irinotecan group and 232 days [148, 319]  in the irinotecan alone group \n(Hazard ratio [95 % CI], 1.075 [0.659, 1.754], p= 0.7720).  \nEGFR expression levels by immunohistochemistry were measured for tumor s of 47 patients, \nand a correlation with OS was assessed. Median OS of the EGFR -positive (EGFR 1+, 2+, 3+, \nN=26) population was 274 days in the nimotuzumab plus irinotecan group, and 222 days in the \nirinotecan alone group (Hazard ratio [95 % CI], 0.747 [0. 317, 1.761], p=0.5033). Median OS of \nEGFR -overexpressi ng (EGFR 2+, 3+, N=14) population was 358.5 days in nimotuzumab plus \nirinotecan group, and 229.5 days in irinotecan alone group (Haz ard ratio [95 % CI], 0.375 [0.097, \n1.442], p=0.1390).  \n \n5.11 Study No. DE766 -A-J302 (terminated early, Gastric).  \n \nThis was a randomized, open -label, multicenter, Japan -Korea -Taiwan collaborative, 2 -arm \nphase III clinical study in patients with EGFR overexpressed advanced or recurrent gastric and \ngastroesophageal junction cancer.

This study was conducted in 34 study sites \nin Japan, 17 study sites in South Korea and 9 study sites in Taiwan. The study initiated in April \n2013 and completed in May 2017.  \nA total of 362 subjects were enrolled in the study and were randomized into 2 groups \ncomprised of nimotuzumab plus irinotecan (n=179) or irinotecan alone (n=183). Nimotuzumab \ntreatment consisted of a 400 mg dose of nimotuzumab administered once a week conc omitantly \nwith irinotecan which consisted of 150 mg/m2 administered once every two weeks. The \ntreatment continued  until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events . \nOf the 362 randomized subjects, 354 subjects were included in the safety analysis set (177 \nsubjects, 177 subjects). The incidence of treatment -emergent AEs was 97.2% (172/177) in the \ncombination group and 98.3% (174/177) in the control group.

The incidence of drug -related SAEs was 14.1% (25/177) \nin the irinotecan plus Nimotuzumab group and 14.7% (26/177) in the irinoteca n group. The most \ncommon drug -related SAEs (≥ 2%) in the Nimotuzumab plus irinotecan group were, febrile \nneutropenia (2.8% [5/177], decreased appetite (2.3% [4/177], asthenia (2.3% [4/177], and nausea \n(1.7% [3/177]. No significant differences were found in  the incidence of serious treatment -related \nAEs between the combination group and the control group. A listing of treatment -related SAEs \nis provided in Appendix C, Table C -1. \nIn the full analysis set population, the primary analysis of OS showed no statistically \nsignificant difference between the treatment groups (P = 0.5574). The results of the primary \nanalysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of OS (stratified log -rank test) in per protocol set \npopulation were consistent with those in the full analysis set population. In the analysis of \nsecondary efficacy endpoint of PFS, the median PFS was 91.0 (95% CI, 84.0 to 113.0) days in \nthe Nimotuzumab plus irinotecan group and 64.5 (95 % CI, 59.0 to 83.0) days in the irinotecan \ngroup, and a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups was found (P = \n0.0027).

Patients were tre ated with \nweekly nimotuzumab infusions (150 mg/m2) for 11 weeks in combination with 6 weeks of \nradiotherapy. The primary objective of this study was to assess progression free survival. \nSecondary objectives included objective response rate (CR+PR+SD), dura tion of response and \noverall survival. This study was conducted in 9 clinical sites in Germany. The study was initiated \nin April 2006 and completed in July 2009.  \nForty -two patients (16 males/26 females) with a mean age of 7.55 years (range 3 to 15 years) \nwere enrolled in the study. All patients were assessed for safety and efficacy.  \nAll patients experienced at least one treatment -emergent adverse event. A total of 368 \ntreatment -emergent adverse events were reported. Out of 368 AEs, 64 AEs reported in 21 patients \n(50%) were assessed as at least possibly or probably related to study dru g. The most reported  \nstudy drug -related AEs (> 2 subjects, 4.76%) were alopecia (6 subjects, 14.3%), vomiting (3 \nsubjects, 7.1%), headache (3 subjects, 7.1%), and radiation skin injury (2 subjects, 7.1%). See \nAppendix B, Table B -12 for a complete listing o f related AEs.  \nThere was a total of 66 serious  adverse events (SAEs) reported in 35 patients (83.3%). Of the \n66 SAEs reported, there were 8 SAEs reported in 2 patients (4.76%) that were considered to be \nrelated to the study and in one (1) patient the SAE was not assessable. A listing of related SAEs \nis presented in Appendix C, Table C -1.  \nThere were 33 patients who died during  the study. In all cases, the investigators assessed the \ncause of death to be unrelated to study drug and due to progressive disease.  \nMedian progression free survival was 175 days [95% CI: 145 - 184], while median overall \nsurvival was 285 days [95% CI: 239 - 352].  \n \n5.13 Study No. IIC RD EC -097 / EF -090 (completed, DIPG)  \n \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 39 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         This was a Phase II, open -label, multinational, single arm study of nimotuzumab added to \nradiotherapy in newly diagnosed children and adolescent with DIPG run in Brazil and Cuba. \nPatients were treated with 150 mg/m2 of nimotuzumab once a week for 12 weeks concurrent with \ndaily radiation of 1.8 Gy for 5 days a week for 6 weeks. There was an evaluation on week 13 and \nif patients had stable disease or better response,  they continue  nimotuzumab monotherapy at 150 \nmg/m2 once every two weeks until disease progres sion, death or unmanageable toxicity. Primary \nendpoint of the study was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of the combination treatment of \nradiotherapy and nimotuzumab in children and adolescents  with DIPG and secondary endpoints \nwere to determine the PFS rate at 6 months, Overall survival, objective response, duration of \nresponse and toxicity. This study was conducted in 5 investigation sites in Cuba and 3 sites in \nBrazil. The study initiated in November 2007 and completed in June 2014.  \nForty -five patients (19 males (42.2 %)/26 females (57.8 %)) with a mean age of 7.87 years \n(range 2 to 17 years) were enrolled in the study. All patients were evaluable for safety and 37 for \nefficacy analysis.  \nA total of 569 treatment -emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported in 35 patients (77.8 \n%). Of the 569 AEs, 515 AEs were not related and 54 AEs in 14 patients (31.1 %) were reported \nto be related to the study drug. The most common study -drug related AEs (> 3 patients, 6.7 %) \nwere vomiting (8 subjects, 17.8 %), headache (4 subjects, 8.9 %), constipation (4 subjects, 8.9 \n%) and bronchospasm (3 subjects, 6.7 %). A listing of treatment -related adverse events is \nprovided in Appendix B, Table B -13. \nThere was a total of 36 serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in 18 patients (40.0 %). Of the \n36 SAEs reported, there were 4 SAEs reported in 2 patients (4.4 %) that were considered to be \nrelated to the study drug. Related SAEs were hiccups, pale skin and  sweating reported in 1 patient \nand anaphylactic shock reported in another patient. A listing of related SAEs is presented in \nAppendix C, Table C -1. There were 21 patients who died during the course of the study. In \nnone of the cases, the investigators ass essed the cause of death to be unrelated to study drug,  and \nit was due to disease progression.  \nThe overall response rate was 44.4 %, the disease control rate was 75.5 %, the median \nprogression free survival time was 9.03 months,  and the median overall survival time was 15.1 \nmonths. The 2 -year PFS and OS rates were 18.0 % and 40.5 % respectively.  \n \n \n5.14 Study No. BN -001 PED -04 (completed, Pediatric Glioma) . \n \nThis was a Phase II, open -label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy of \nnimotuzumab in chemotherapy -resistant high -grade gliomas in children and adolescents. The \nstudy included pediatric patients (≥3 to ≤20 years) with a histologically proven diagnosis of high \ngrade gliomas of WHO Grade III or IV, radiologically proven progressive disease following \nprimary or relapse treatment, at least one -dimensionally measurable disease, suffi cient \nhematological , renal and hepatic function, a life expecta ncy of ≥ 4 weeks upon entry into the \nstudy, and without chemo - or radiotherapy within the last 3 weeks prior entry.  Patients were \nadministered  nimotuzumab 150 mg/m2 i.v. infusion once a week for 6 weeks, they had an \nevaluation on week 8 and if there was a stable disease or better response,  they continued  \nmaintenance treatment of nimotuzumab at 150 mg/m2 every 3 weeks until disease progression, \ndeath or unmanageable toxicity. The study was conducted in 27 centers in Germany and it \ninitiated in June 2004 and completed in April 2007.  \nForty -seven (47) patients were enrolled and treated with at least one dose of nimotuzumab.  \nSafety data are available for all 47 patients.  Twenty -nine (29) boys and 18 girls, with a mean \nage of 10 years (range 4 to 17) were assessed for safety and forty -five (45) patients (27 males \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 40 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         and 18 females) with median age of 10.2 years, range (4 -17 years) were assessed for efficacy. \nEleven patients (24.4 %) had anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), 13 patients (28.9 %) had glioblastoma \n(GBM), and 21 patients (46.7 %) had diffused  intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).  \nSafety population was composed of 47 patients. A total of 157 treatment -emergent adverse \nevents (AEs) were reported in 43 patients (91.5%). Of the 157 AEs, 113 AEs were not related \nand 44 AEs in 22 patients (46.8%) were reported to be related to the study drug. The most \ncommon study -drug related AEs (> 3 patients, 6.4 %) were erythema (4 subjects, 8.5 %), \nleukopenia (4 subjects, 8.5 %), fatigue (3 subjects, 6.4 %), headache (3 subjects, 6.4 %), nausea \n(3 subjects, 6.4 %) and vomiting (3 subjects, 6.4 %). Re lated AEs are provided in Appendix B, \nTable B -14. \nA total of 93 SAEs were experienced in 37 patients (78.7 %) during the study period. None of \nthe SAEs or deaths reported in this study were assessed as being related to nimotuzumab therapy \n(one event was considered not assessable and is provided in Appendix C, Table C -1). Thirty \npatients (63.8 %) died during or 30 days following the last dose of study drug. In all cases, the \ninvestigators assessed the causal relationships of death to be unrelated to study drug  \nAt 8 weeks, in the group of AA, there was 1 PR (9.1 %) and 2 SD (18.2 %), in the group of \nGBM there was 3 SD (23.1 %) and on the DIPG group there was 1 PR (4.8 %) and 10 SD (47.6 \n%). Overall, the response rate for all patients was 2 PR (4.4 %) and 15 SD (3 3.3 %) (Figure 10). \nThe disease control rate [95% CI] was 37.8 % [23.8, 53.5 %]. From all responders, the mean \nduration of response was 4.43 months. For all patients assessed for efficacy, the median time to \nprogression [95 % CI] was 1.67 months [1.47, 1.8 ] and median survival time [95 % CI] was 4.33 \nmonths [3.3, 5.37]. Among responders, median time to progression was 4.73 months and median \nsurvival time was 6.3 months [3.63, 9.47].  \n \n5.15 Study No. YMB -1000 -013 (completed, DIPG) . \n \nThis was a phase II, open -label, single -arm, multicenter study designed to assess the safety \nand efficacy of nimotuzumab in pediatric patients with recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.  \nPatients were treated with 150 mg/m2 nimotuzumab administered weekly for 8 weeks (induction \nphase) then once every 2 weeks for 10 weeks (consolidation phase).  The primary objectives of \nthe study were to evaluate the objective response rate and the safety profile of nimotuzumab in \nthis popul ation. The study was conduc ted in 12 investigation sites in Canada and United States \nand it initiated in February 2008 and completed in June 2010.  \nForty -six (46) patients were enrolled in the study. Forty -four (44) were treated with at least \none dose of nimotuzumab and were therefore assessable for safety and efficacy.   Twenty (20) \nmales and 24 females participated in the study.  The mean age of the patients was 7.5 years (range \n3 to 17 years).  \nThere were 488 AEs reported in 43 patients (97.7 %) during the study period. Of 488 AEs \nreported, there were 54 AEs reported in 24 patients (54.5 %) that were considered to be drug -\nrelated AEs. The most common study -drug related AEs (> 2 subjects, 4.55%) w ere nausea (4 \nsubjects, 9.1 %), rash (4 subjects, 9.1 %) and lymphopenia (3 subjects, 6.8 %). A list of related \nAEs is provided in Appendix B, Table B -15.  \nA total of 19 patients (43.18%) experienced 30 SAEs. Out of 30 SAE reported, 2 SAEs in 1 \npatient (22.7%) were considered to be related to the study drug. Two patients discontinued study \ndrug due to their SAEs; one patient discontinued due to hydrocephalus while the other \ndiscontinued due to intracranial tumor  hemorrhage and tumor  necrosis. See Appendix C, Table \nC-1 for a complete listing of possibly related SAEs. Seven (7) patients died during the course of \nthe study because of  disease progression.  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 41 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         At week 8, the clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 18.2 % [95% CI: 6.8 – 29.6]. At week 18, the \nORR was 2.3 % [95 % CI: 0.0 – 6.7] and the CBR was 9.1 % [95 % CI: 0.6 – 17.6]. No patient \nhad a complete response. The time to progression following initiation of nimotuzumab treatment \nfor the 1 subject with PR and 3 subjects with SD at Week 18 was 182, 119, 157 and 335 days, \nrespectively. The median duration of response, time to progression, and overall survival were 2.1 \nmonths [95 % CI: 1.2 – 3.4], 1.7 months [95 % CI: 1.4 – 1.9], and 3.2 months [95 % CI: 2.2 – \n4.3], respectively.  \n \n5.16 Study No. IIC RD EC -053 (completed, Anaplastic Astrocytoma and Glioblastoma \nMultiforme) . \n \nThis was a multi -center, open -label phase I/II clinical study.  Patients were treated with 200 \nmg of nimotuzumab once a week for 6 weeks concurrent with daily radiation 5 days a week for \n6 weeks. This study was conducted in 5 investigation sites in Cuba and it initiated in February \n2002 and completed in February 2005.  \nTwenty -nine (29) patients were enrolled in the study, 13 males and 16 females with a mean \nage of 46 years (range 20 to 64 years). Patients with glioblastoma multiforme (16 patients), \nanaplastic astrocytoma (12 patients), and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (1  patient) were included \nin the study.  \nThere were 311 adverse events (AEs) reported in 18 patients (62.07%) during study period. \nOut of 311 AEs, there were 15 AEs reported in 7 patients (24.1%) that were considered to be \nrelated to study drug. The most common nimotuzumab -related AEs (> 2 subjec ts, 6.9%) were \nchills (4 subjects, 13. 8%), alanine aminotransferase out of range (3 subjects, 10.3 %) and nausea \n(2 subjects, 6.9 %). Related adverse events are summarized in Appendix B, Table B -16. \nIn the study, there were 16 SAEs reported in 8 patients (27.6 %) who experienced serious \nadverse events during the study period, all of which were single events reported by no more than \n1 patient. None of the serious adverse events were considered by the i nvestigators to be related \nto nimotuzumab treatment. No patients discontinued due to adverse events. Nineteen (19) (66 %) \npatients died during  the study;  however, all these deaths were attributed to disease progression.  \nImaging  primary tumor s using computed tomography and MRI scans was conducted prior to \ninclusion, at week 8, at month 3 and every 3 months thereafter.  Tumor  response was evaluated \nusing NCI RECIST.  Patients were followed for survival until death.  \nIn the ITT population (N=29), the best response was classified as follows: 5 patients (17.2 %) \nachieved CR, 6 patients (20.7 %) achieved PR. Objective response (CR+PR) was seen in 11 of \n29 patients included in the trial (37.9 %). Stable disease was the bes t response in 11 patients (37.9 \n%). In 3 patients (10.3 %) the best response was PD. The remaining 4 patients were lost to follow \nup. The median overall survival time was 22.2 months,  and the median progression free survival \ntime was 16.3 months.  \nIn the TTG population (N=24), 5 patients (20.8 %) achieved CR and 6 patients (25 %) \nachieved PR. Objective response (CR+PR) was seen in 11 of 24 evaluable patients included in \nthe trial (45.8 %). The best response was evaluated as SD in 11 patients (45.8 % ). Only 1 patient \n(4.2 %) reported PD as his best response in this analysis,  and one patient was censored. The \nmedian overall survival time was 22.3 months,  and the median progression free survival time \nwas 18.5 months.  \n \n5.17 Study No. IIC RD EC -069 (completed, Anaplastic Astrocytoma and Glioblastoma \nMultiforme).  \n \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 42 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         This was a Phase III, controlled, randomized, double blind study to evaluate the efficacy of \nnimotuzumab combined with radiotherapy compared to radiotherapy plus placebo in patients \nwith high grade glioma. On the treatment arm patients were administered we ekly 200 mg \nnimotuzumab infusion for six weeks together with 60 Gy conventional radiotherapy and then \nmaintenance dose of 200 mg nimotuzumab every 21 days during 1 year of treatment and on the \ncontrol arm patients received weekly administration of 4 vials of placebo infusions for six weeks \ntogether with 60 Gy conventional radiotherapy and then maintenance of 4 vials of placebo every \n21 days until 1 year of treatment was completed. Primary endpoint  was to evaluate the efficacy \nwith respect to survival in th e combined treatment humanized mAb anti -EGFR (nimotuzumab) \nand radiotherapy versus radiotherapy and placebo in patients with high grade gliomas and \nsecondary endpoints were to evaluate the progression -free intervals in patients treated with the \ntreatment p roposed in this study, evaluate the toxicity of nimotuzumab combined with \nradiotherapy in the study patients and determine the prognosis or prediction value of the \nexpression of the EGFR on the effect of the study treatment. This study was conducted in 8 \ninvestigation sites in Cuba, and it initiated in June 2005 and completed in June 2010.  \nA total of 70 patients were included in the study. Thirty -two (32) patients on the nimotuzumab \nplus radiotherapy arm and 38 patients on the placebo plus radiotherapy arm.  \nA total of 398 adverse events in 52 patients (185 AEs in 24 patients (75%) in the radiotherapy \nplus nimotuzumab arm and 213 AEs reported in 28 patients (73.7%) in the radiotherapy plus \nplacebo arm) were reported independent of the causality. Out of 185 AEs  reported on the \nradiotherapy plus nimotuzumab arm there were 40 AEs reported in 9 patients (28.1%) on which \nthe causality was assessed as possible or probably  related to the study drug. The most reported  \nstudy drug -related AEs (> 2 subjects, 6.25%) were a lanine aminotransferase increase  (5 subjects, \n15.6%), anorexia (2 subjects, 6.25%), nausea (2 subjects, 6.25%), pyrexia (2 subjects, 6.25%), \ndizziness (2 subjects, 6.25%) and tremors (2 subjects, 6.25%). See Appendix B, Table B -17 for \na complete listing of related AEs.  \nThere were 41 SAEs reported in 26 patients (13 SAEs reported in 6 patients (18.8%) in the \nradiotherapy plus nimotuzumab arm and 28 SAEs reported in 10 patients (26.3%) in the \nradiotherapy plus placebo arm) during the study period. Out of 13 SAEs in the rad iotherapy plus \nnimotuzumab arm, none of these SAEs were reported by the investigators to be related to the \nstudy drug.  \nThere were 44 patients who died during the course of the study, 17 from the radiotherapy plus \nnimotuzumab arm and 27 from the radiotherapy and placebo arm. In all cases, the investigators \nassessed the cause of death to be unrelated to study drug and due to  progressive disease.  \nMedian overall survival for patients treated with nimotuzumab plus radiotherapy was 17.76 \nmonths compared to 12.63 months for patients of the placebo plus radiotherapy arm, with a HR \n= 0.64.  \n \n5.18 Study No. CLG007/BIO005/GLIO/h -R3/2005 (completed, Glioblastoma \nMultiforme) . \n \nThis was a Phase II, open label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of \nnimotuzumab as induction and maintenance therapy in combination with radiotherapy plus \ntemozolomide (concomitant & adjuvant) in Indian patients with glioblastoma mult iforme (grade \n4 astrocytoma).  The primary objective was to assess overall survival. Secondary objectives \nincluded assessment of progression free survival and objective response rate. The study was  \nconducted in 10 clinical sites in India and it  initiated i n October 2007 and completed in August \n2010.  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 43 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         The subjects underwent four stages of treatment: concomitant stage, adjuvant stage, \nmaintenance stage and extended maintenance stage. In the concomitant stage nimotuzumab was \nadministered in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide (75 mg/m2). Four weeks \nfollowing the end of radiotherapy, the adjuvant stage began, which involved concomitant \nadministration of nimotuzumab (200 mg) and temozolomide (150 – 200 mg/m2). Following \ncompletion of 6 cycles of temozolomide, patients were administered nimotuzumab  in the \nmaintenance and extended maintenance phases until disease progression. Nimotuzumab was \nadministered once weekly during the first 6 weeks of the trial, and every 3 weeks thereafter.  \nA total of 56 patients were enrolled:  41 males (73.2 %) and 15 females (26.8 %) with a mean \nage of 51 years (range 22 to 70 years). All patients were assessed for safety and efficacy.  \nIn the study, there were 598 AEs reported in 51 patients (91.1%). Out of 598 AEs reported, \nthere were 51 AEs reported in 9 patients (16.1%) that were considered to be related to the \ntreatment of nimotuzumab, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The most reported  study drug -\nrelated AEs (> 2 subjects, 3.57%) were chills (4 subjects, 7.14%) and pyrexia (4 subjects, 7.14%). \nMost  AEs were mild or moderate in severity. See Appendix B, Table B -18 for a complete listing \nof related AEs.  \nThere were 50 SAEs reported in 28 patients (50.0 %) during the study period. Out 50 SAEs \nreported, only 1 SAE that consisted of stomatitis reported in 1 patient (1.79) was considered \nrelated to nimotuzumab. A listing of related SAEs is presented in Appendix C, Table C -1. \nDuring the trial, 1 patient withdrew due to an adverse event and 8 patients died while on study. \nNone of the events reported as leading to death were assessed as related to study drug.  \nMedian overall survival in the ITT population was 14.1 months [95% CI: 10.4 - 17.3 months]. \nMedian progression free survival was 9.3 months [95% CI: 5.5 - 11.2 months]. The objective \nresponse rate (ORR) [95% CI] at 12 months was 17.6 % [7.2 – 28.1 %] and 1 2.0 % [3.0, 21.0%] \nat 24 months. The 1 -yr OS rate [95 % CI] was 56.9 % [43.3, 70.5 %] and 2 -yr OS rate was 26.5 \n% [14.2, 38.9%].  \n \n5.19 Study No. OSAG -101-BSA -05 (completed GBM).  \n \nThis was a Phase III, open label, controlled randomized multicenter clinical study designed to \nassess efficacy of standard radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant OSAG 101 (Theraloc®) \n(nimotuzumab) plus Temozolomide vs. standard radiotherapy plus concom itant and adjuvant \nTemozolomide in patient with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioblastoma \nmultiforme. Patients were treated with weekly nimotuzumab infusions (400 mg) for 12 weeks \nand then every two weeks until disease progression in combinati on with 6 weeks of radiotherapy \nand Temozolomide 75 mg/m2 per day for 7 days a week for 6 weeks then 150 -200 mg/m2 for 5 \ndays a week starting on Week 10 every 28 days. The primary objective of this clinical trial was \nto investigate the influence of treatme nt Arm A (standard radiotherapy plus concomitant and \nadjuvant OSAG 101 (Theraloc®) plus temozolomide) on the progression -free survival (PFS) \ncompared to treatment Arm B (standard radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant \nTemozolomide). The study was condu cted in 9 centers in Germany and it initiated in August \n2007 and completed in September 2010.  \nIn total, 149 adult male and female patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed \nglioblastoma multiforme Grade IV were enrolled from 11 active study centers  in Germany. All \npatients were randomized (Arm A: n=75, Arm B: n=74), but seven patients were excluded from \nefficacy analyses due to discontinuation before start of therapy or major protocol violations. \nTherefore, 142 patients (Arm A: n=71, Arm B: n=71) we re analyzed for efficacy (FAS/PP) and \nsafety.  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 44 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         A total of 142 patients (Arm A: n=71, Arm B: n=71) were  analyzed for efficacy (Full Analysis \nSet/Per Protocol - FAS/PP) in this superiority trial. The progression status after 52 weeks as \nprimary efficacy variable showed no statistically  significant difference between Arm A and Arm \nB. On average, patients treated in Arm A were non -progressive for 7.7 months (235 days) \ncompared to 5.8 months (178 days) in treatment Arm B. The progression -free survival (PFS) was \nnot statistically significan t between Arm A and  Arm B. The subgroup of patients with non – \nmethylated MGMT status showed a delta of 16.5 % for the 6 -months -PFS rate (6 -months PFS \nrate, Arm A: 63.3 % vs. Arm B: 46.9 %) but did not reach statistically  significant p (0.2125).  \nThe overall survival (OS) as secondary efficacy variable was longer in treatment Arm A \ncompared to Arm B. However, this difference was not statistically significant. The RT + \nTemozolomide + Nimotuzumab arm (Arm A) reached 22.3 months median OS, and the med ian \nOS of 19.6 months with RT + Temozolomide (Arm B), with a p -value of 0.4856 and with a delta \nof 2.7 months (Stupp Protocol 1.7 months).  \nAll 142 patients enrolled who received at least one dose of the study medication were included \nin the safety analysis. There were 558 adverse events (AEs) (494 were non -serious and 64 were \nclassified as SAE) reported in 67 patients (94.4%) in the radiother apy plus chemotherapy plus \nnimotuzumab arm. Out 558 AEs in the radiotherapy plus chemotherapy plus nimotuzumab arm, \n220 AEs in 45 patients (63.4%) the causality was assessed as possible, probable or definite related \nto the study drug. The most common study -drug related AEs (> 5 subjects, 7.04%) were fatigue \n(14 subjects, 19.7%), nausea (11 subjects, 15.5%), thrombocytopenia (9 subjects, 12.7%), rash \n(9 subjects, 12.7%), vomiting (8 subjects, 11.3%), alopecia (7 subjects, 9.9%), lymphopenia (5 \nsubjects, 7.04 %) and acne (5 subjects, 7.04%). See Appendix B, Table B -19 for a complete \nlisting of related AEs.  \nThere were  64 SAEs reported in 28 patients (39.4%) on radiotherapy , chemotherapy and \nnimotuzumab arm during the study period. Out of 64 SAEs, on 16 SAEs reported in 7 patients \n(9.86%) the causality was assessed to be probable, possible or definite related to the study drug. \nThe most common related to the study drug SAEs (> subjects, 2.82%) were  leukopenia (2 \nsubjects, 2.82%), thrombocytopenia (2 subjects, 2.82%) and pulmonary embolism (2 subjects, \n2.82%). A listing of related SAEs is presented in Appendix C , Table C -1. \nThere were seven cases of death documented as SAEs related to the underlying disease. In no \ncase, did the investigator see a causal relationship between the death of a patient and the \napplication of the study drug.  \n \n5.20 Study No. IIC RD EC -0114 (completed, Glioma Adult).  \n \nThis was a Phase IV, open -label, multicenter study to assess the safety and tolerability of \nnimotuzumab in combination with standard of care (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) in the \ntreatment of newly diagnosed or recurrent high -grade glioma tumors. Prima ry endpoint was the \nevaluation of safety and efficacy,  and secondary endpoints were to determine the incidence of \nadverse event related with nimotuzumab administration (with probable or very probable causal \nrelationship), OS, ORR, and PFS. In this study pa tients received nimotuzumab 200 mg i.v . \ninfusion once a week for 6 weeks and then every 2 weeks until non -tolerable toxicity or \nwithdrawal from study, radiotherapy 50 -60 Gy, 1.8 -2.0 Gy once a day for 5 days a week for 5 -6 \nweeks and standard chemotherapy for brain tumors. This study was conducted in 11 \ninvestigational sites in Cuba and it initiated in September 2008 and completed in September \n2013.  \nOne hundred and forty -five (145) patients were enrolled in this study and 139 were evaluable \nfor the analysis, of them 127 newly diagnosed and 12 recurrent or relapsed patients. There were \n95 GBM (92 newly diagnosed and 3 recurrent), 33 anaplastic astrocyt omas (25 newly diagnosed  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 45 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         and 8 recurrent) and 10 oligoastrocytomas (9 newly diagnosed and 1 relapsed). The patient \npopulation consisted of 82 males and 57 females with mean age of 49 years (range 19 -82 years). \nOne hundred four (104) patients (74.8 %) were treated with nimotuzumab plus radiotherapy, 27 \npatients (19.4 %) with nimotuzumab monotherapy and 8 patients (5.8 %) with nimotuzumab plus \nradiotherapy and chemotherapy.  \nOf 139 patients treated with study drug there were 101 (92 out 127 newly diagnosed patients \n(72.4 %) and 9 out of 12 recurrent or relapsed patients (75.0 %)) who experienced at least one \nadverse event (AE). There was a total of 806 AEs (749 AEs from newly diagnosed patients and \n57 AEs from recurrent or relapsed patients) reported in 101 patients (72.7%). Of 806 AEs \nreported, 82 AEs that occurred in 30 patients (21.6 %) were considered probable, possible or \ndefinite related to the study drug. The most common  study -drug related AEs (> 3 patients, 2.16 \n%) were headache (8 subjects, 5.76 %), pyrexia (8 subjects, 5.76 %), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (5 subjects, 3.60 %), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (4 subjects, 2.88 %), chills \n(4 subjects, 2.88 %) , hypertension (3 subjects, 2.16 %) and tremors (3 subjects, 2.16 %). A listing \nof treatment -related adverse events is provided in Appendix B, Table B -20. \nThere was a total of 107 serious  adverse events (SAEs) reported in 30 patients (21.6%). Of \nthe 107 SAEs reported during the study period, 4 SAEs in 2 patients (1.4%) were assessed to be \nrelated to the study drug, patient JRL -MDG -1 who experienced 3 SAEs from an infusion reaction \n(pyrexia , chills and tremors) and patient TC -ROM -21 who experienced 1 SAE consisting of \nseizures. A listing of related SAEs is presented in Appendix C, Table C -1.  \nThere were 14 deaths reported during the study period, 13 from newly diagnosed patients and \n1 from recurrent or relapsed patients. None of the death were related to the study drug.  \nOut of 139 patients included on the study, 106 were evaluable for response, 96 newly diagnosed \nand 10 recurrent or relapsed patients. From the 96 newly diagnosed patients there were 44 \ncomplete responses (45.8 %), 15 partial response s (15.6 %), 17 stable disease (17.7 %) and 20 \npatients (20.8 %) progressed and from the 10 recurrent or relapsed there were 5 complete \nresponses (50 %), 2 partial responses (20 %) and 3 patients (30 %) progressed. In total, there \nwere 49 completed responses  out of 106 patients ( 46.2 %), 17 partial responses (16.04 %), 17 \nstable disease (16.04 %) and 23 progressive diseases (21.7 %). Median PFS and OS for newly \ndiagnosed (127) patients were 8.86 months and 12.23 months, respectively and for the recurrent \nor relapsed (12) patients were 7.73 months and 18.36 months, respectively.  \n \n5.21 Study No. M9/CIMAB/AEC -03 (completed, Glioma Adult).  \nThis was a Phase IV, open -label, multicenter study to assess the safety and tolerability of \nnimotuzumab in combination with chemoradiation or radiotherapy in the treatment of either \nnewly diagnosed or recurrent high -grade glioma tumors. Primary endpoint wa s the evaluation of \nthe incidence of adverse events related to nimotuzumab administration (with probable or very \nprobable causal relationship), and secondary endpoints were to determine OS, PFS and ORR.  \nIn this study newly di agnosed patients received nimotuzumab 200 mg i.v . infusion once a \nweek for 6 weeks and then every 2 weeks until non -tolerable toxicity or withdrawal from study, \nradiotherapy 50 -60 Gy, 1.8 -2.0 Gy once a day for 5 days a week for 5 -6 weeks and standard \nchemotherapy for brain tumors. Recurrent patients or w ith progressive disease received \nnimotuzumab alone 200 mg i.v. infusion once a week for 6 weeks and then every 2 weeks until \nnon-tolerable toxicity or withdrawal from the study. This st udy was conducted in 6 investigation \nsites in Cuba and initiated in January 2013 and completed the recruitment of patients in \nNovember 2016.  \nNinety -three  (93) patients were enrolled in this study and 63 were evaluable for the analysis, \nof them 62 received at least one dose of nimotuzumab (56 newly diagnosed and 6 recurrent or \nrelapsed patients). There were 43 GBM (42 newly diagnosed and 1 recurrent), 17 an aplastic \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 46 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         astrocytomas (13 newly diagnosed  and 4 recurrent), 1 anaplastic oligoastrocytomas (newly \ndiagnosed and 1 anaplastic oligodendroglioma (relapsed). The patient population had a mean age \nof 50 years (range 19 -75 years). From the 56 patients included treated with nimotuzumab in the \nnewly dia gnosed group, 47 patients (84%) received nimotuzumab plus radiotherapy, 7 patients \n(12%) received nimotuzumab plus radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (temozolomide), and 2 \npatients received nimotuzumab alone. In the recurrent gr oup 2 patients received nimotuzumab \nplus radiotherapy and 4 patients received nimotuzumab alone.  \nOf 62 patients evaluated that were treated with study drug there were 46 patients (74%) who \nexperienced at least one adverse event (AE), 41 patients (66%) in the newly diagnosed group and \n5 patients (8%) in the recurrent or relapsed group.  There was a tot al of 442 AEs (392 AEs from \nnewly diagnosed patients, representing 89% of the total of AEs reported in the study and 50 AEs \nfrom recurrent or relapsed patients, representing 11% of the total of AEs reported).  \nOf 442 AEs reported, 20 AEs (4.5%) that occurred in 8 patients (13 %) were considered \nprobable, possible or definite related to the study drug. These 20 AEs related to the study drug \nwere divided into 12 (2.7%) in the newly diagnosed group and 8 (1.8%) in the recurrent or \nrelapsed group. The most common study -drug related AEs were chills (0.17 %) and skin rash \n(0.5%) A listing of treatment -related adverse events is provided in Appendix B, Table B -21.  \nThere was a total of 40 SAEs (9%) reported in 15 patients, 13 patients (21%) in the newly \ndiagnosed group and 2 patients (3.2%) in the recurrent or relapsed group. From the total of 40 \nSAEs reported in the study, 38 SAEs (8.5%) were assessed in the newly d iagnosed group,  and 2 \nSAEs (0.5%) were assessed in the recurrent or relapsed group. There was a total of 8 serious \nadverse events (1.8%) reported in 4 patients that were related to the study drug, all of them \nclassified as grade 3 or 4. Six (1.3%) of the r eported SAEs occurred in the newly diagnosed group \nand 2 (0.5%) occurred in the recurrent or relapsed group. A listing of related SAEs is presented \nin Appendix C, Table C -1.  \nThere were 43 deaths reported during the study period, representing 69.3% of the 62 patients \nevaluated in the study, classified in 39 patients (91%) in the newly diagnosed group and 4 patients \n(9%) in the recurrent or relapsed group. None of the death were related to the study drug, being \nthe most common cause of death the dis ease progression, with 26 patients (42%), divided in 25 \npatients (96%) in the newly diagnosed group and 1 patient (4%) in the recurrent or relapsed \ngroup.  \nForty -eight  out of the 93 patients included in the study were evaluable for response, all of \nthem in the newly diagnosed group, which represents 86% of the 56 patients in this group who \nreceived nimotuzumab in the study. From the 48 patients evaluated there were 19 complete \nresponses (40 %), 6 partial response s (12 %), 15 stable disease (31 %) and 8 patients (17 %) \nprogressed. Fifty -six patients in the newly diagnosed group were evaluated for median PFS and \nOS. The PFS and OS for newly diagnosed patients we re 8.8 months and 15.3 months, \nrespectively. Patients in the recurrent or relapsed group were not evaluated for efficacy due to \nthe small number  of subjects.  \n \n5.22 Study No. BT-NI-GL-1 (completed, Glioma  Adult ). \n \nThis was a Phase I, non-randomized, open -label, dose -escalation clinical design , single center  \nstudy to  evaluate the tolerability and early effectiveness of nimotuzumab combined with \nradiotherapy and chemotherapy in the treatment of malignant glioma, and to recommend dosing \nregimens for later clinical studies .  \nThe p rimary endpoint of the study was the tolerability of nimotuzumab combined with \ncorresponding standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens for newly treated malignant \nglioma , and secondary endpoints were disease -free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). For \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 47 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         the evaluation of tolerability and safety of nimotuzumab  in the combination therapy , the \ncorresponding standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens and doses  were fixed , and a \ndose escalation approach was adopted to gradually increase the dose level of nimotuzumab . \nRadiotherapy started 2 to 4 weeks after surgery, with a radiation dose of 2Gy per day, 5 days \na week, for a total of 6 weeks, with a total radiation dose of 60Gy . Temozolomide was \nadministered simultaneously with radiation at a dose of 75 mg/m²/d, 7 days a week × 6 cycles . \nPatients who received Carmustine (BCNU)  as chemotherapy , were administered at a dose of 80 \nmg/m2 /d, 1 day per week × 8 weeks.  Nimotuzumab was administered in three groups of patients \nreceiving 100mg, 200mg and 400mg/week, 3 cases/group. The drug was administered \nintravenously. The infusion time was no less than 60 minutes, once a week, a total of 6 times.  \nThe study evaluated first the lower dose , and e ach dose was always infused before chemotherapy \nand radiotherapy.  This study initiated in April 2011 and completed in June 2013. There were 3 \ncases in the 100  mg group, 3 cases in the 200  mg group, and 3 cases in the 400  mg group. All \nsubjects completed the trial medication, and no patient terminated treatment due to treatment - \nrelated adverse events . \nAs of the cut -off date of follow -up on May 27, 2013, 3 cases died, 2 cases were alive, and 4 \ncases were lost to follow -up. The median DFS was 10.53 months,  and the median OS was 20.10. \nmonths.  \nIn th e safety analysis , nimotuzumab combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy failed to \nreach the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the treatment of malignant glioma, with low (100 \nmg/w), medium (200 mg/w), and high doses (400 mg/w) being well tolerated. No serious or \nimportant adverse events occurred.  \nAdverse events occurred in 8 of all 9 patients enrolled in the study, with an incidence rate of  \n88.9%; including 11 cases of adverse events in the blood/bone marrow system (57.9%); 2 \ncases in the skin system (10.5%); and 3 cases in the urinary system (15.8%); systemic symptoms \nin 2 cases (10.5%); gastrointestinal tract in 1 case (5.2%). A listing of treatment -related adverse \nevents is provided in Appendix B, Table B -22. \nThe common adverse events related or possibly related to nimotuzumab included leukopenia \n(6 cases /time), urinary occult blood (3 cases /time), neutropenia (1 case), platelet count decreased \n(1 case), rash (1 case), AST increased (1 case), ALT increased (1  case). All adverse events \nrecorded were classified as grade 1-2 according to CTCAE3.0. No adverse events of grade 3 or \nabove occurred, no serious adverse events were observed, no subjects withdrew from the study \ndue to adverse events, and no deaths occurr ed during the study period.  \nIn terms of laboratory tests: a total of 14 laboratory test abnormalities occurred in the study, \nincluding 6 cases of leukopenia, 1 leukocyte increase, 1 neutrophil decrease, 1 platelet decrease, \nand 3 cases of urinary occult blood and ALT. One case each with elevated AST enzyme. There \nwere 13 cases of abnormal laboratory test indicators related to nimotuzumab, and the adverse \nevent grades were all grade 1 -2. Among them, 6 cases had a decrease in white blood cells, 1 case \nhad a decrease in neutr ophils, 1 ca se had a decrease in platelets, and 3 cases had positive urinary \noccult blood.  \nFrom the safety data obtained in this study, nimotuzumab combined with radiotherapy and \nchemotherapy in the treatment of malignant glioma failed to reach the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD)  evaluated at  low (100mg/w), medium (200mg/w),  and high (400 mg/w) doses.  The high \ndose (400 mg/w) was tolerable, and the adverse events observed in the study were all grade 1 -2; \nno serious adverse events or unexpected adverse events occurred.   \n \n5.23 Study No. Nimotuzumab/SCCHN/2010 (completed, SCCHN)  \n \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 48 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         Patients with locally advanced squamous head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were \nenrolled in a two -arm, randomized, open -label, Phase III trial to investigate the efficacy and \ntoxicity of addition of Nimotuzumab during concurrent chemoradiation. The pri mary objective \nis to determine the PFS at 2 years and the secondary objective is the locoregional response ( LCR ) \nat 24 weeks  from visit of randomization , locoregional control at 2 years, OS, quality of life and \nsafety. After the subjects fulfilled all the eligibility criteria were stratified on the basis of T -group \n(T0,1,2 vs T3,4), N -group (N0,1 vs N2,3), site ( oropharynx versus non oropharynx), technique \nof radiation (conventional versus others) and randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive chemoradiation \n(CRT arm) or Nimotuzumab plus chemoradiation (NCRT arm). In both arms, cisplatin was dosed \n30 mg/m2 weekly for 7 weeks and total 66 -70 Gy over a period of 6.5 -7 weeks. In study arm, \nNimotuzumab was administered 200 mg weekly for 7 weeks. The median duration of f ollow up \nwas 39.13 months (39.5 months in the CRT arm and 39.0 months in the NCRT arm). This trial \nwas initiated in 2012 and completed enrollment in 2018.  \nA total of 536 patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of head and \nneck in stage III/IVA,  B with KPS >70 was included in the study. Two hundred and sixty -eight \n(268) patients (mean age 54years) were randomized to control arm, and 268 patients (mean age \n55 years) were randomized to the study arm. No significant differences were detected between \nthe two arms regarding demography or tumor  characteristics.  \nMost common grade 3 -5 AEs observed were mucositis, radiation dermatitis, odynophagia \nand dysphagia. Addition of Nimotuzumab to chemoradiation did not produce additional toxicity \nexcept grade 3 -5 mucositis which was significantly higher in study arm. A listing of treatment -\nrelated adverse events is provided in Appendix B, Table B -23. \nTwo hundred thirty -five patients experienced disease progression, including 134 in the \ncontrol arm and 101 in the study arm. The sites of progression in the CRT arm were \nlocoregional in 105 patients (39.2%), distant in 24 patients (9%) and both in 5 patients (1.9%). \nThe corresponding sites of progression in the NCRT study arm were locoregional in 70 patients \n(26.1%), distant in 20 patients (7.5%), and both in 11 patients (4.1%).  \nThe addition of nimotuzumab significantly improved the PFS (HR 0.69; 95% CO, 0.53 -\n0.89; P = .004) . The 2 -year follow for PFS was 61.8% (95% CI, 55.2 – 67.7) in the NCRT arm \nand 50.1% (95% CI, 43.7 – 56.2) in the CRT arm.  The addition of nimotuzumab led to a \nconsistent benefit across all subgroups.  \nThe addition of nimotuzumab decreased the hazard of the disease recurrence by 29% (HR \n0.71; 95% CI, 0.55 – 0.92; P=0.008 ). The 2 -year DFS was 60.2% ; 95% CI, 53.6% - 66.3%)  in \nthe NCRT arm compared with the CRT arm ( 48.5% ; 95% CI, 42.1% - 54.7%) . \nThe increment in PFS from the addition of nimotuzumab was because of a decrease in the \nlocoregional failures (P=0.006). The 2 -year locoregional control rate was significantly better \nin the NCRT arm (67.5%; 95% CI, 60.9% - 73.3%)  than in the CRT arm (57.6%; 95% CI, \n50.9% - 63.6%). The addition of nimotuzumab led to a 33% reduction (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50 \n– 0.89; P=0.006) in the risk of locoregional failure, and the reduction was consistent across all \nsubg roups.  \nThere were 128 deaths in the CRT arm and 113 in the NCRT arm (HR 0.84; 95 CI, 0.65 – \n1.08; P=0.163) , therefore the addition of nimotuzumab had a trend towards improved OS in \nthe study arm compared to control arm . The 2 -year OS was 63.8% (95 CI, 57.3% - 69.6%) and \n57.7% (95% CI, 51.3% - 63.6%) in the NCRT and CRT arms, respectively.  \nFor objective responses post -chemoradiation, there were evaluable 239 patients (89.2%) in \nthe CRT arm and 233 patients (86.9%) in the NCRT arm (P=0.424). The overall response \namong evaluable patients was 89.1 -5 (n = 123) in the CRT arm versus 89.3% (n = 208) in the \nNCRT arm. A complete response post -treatment completion was documented in 62.7 -5 of \npatients in the CRT arm (n = 168) and in 61.6% of patients (n =  165) in the NCRT arm.  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 49 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         Salvage surgery for residual disease was planned in the multidisciplinary clinic for 72 \npatients, including 34 in the CRT arm and 38 in the NCRT arm. Of the 34 patients in the CRT \narm, 22 underwent salvage surgery, 5 progressed before salvage surgery, and 7 patients refused \nsurgery. The 26 salvage surger ies performed were lymph node dissection in 13 patients, local \nexcision in 1 patient, and both local excision and neck lymph node dissection in 12 patients.  \nThere was a significant interaction between HPV status and treatment outcomes. The HR \nfor PFS in p16 -negative oropharyngeal cancer was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.36 – 0.79), whereas HR for \np16-positive cancers was 2.6 (95% CI, 0.57 – 11.9). the 2 -year PFS was 31.5% ( 95% CI, 21.5% \n- 42.0%) in the CRT arm and 57.2% (95% CI, 45.8% - 67.1%) in the NCRT arm in patients \nwith p16 -negative oropharyngeal cancer (P = 0.001). A similar higher magnitude of benefit \nwas observed regarding  DFS (HR , 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37 – 0.82; P = 0.0 06), LRC (HR, 0.61; 95% \nCI, 0.4 – 0.94; P = 0.024), and OS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 – 0.92; P = 0.018. The 2 -year OS \nwas o.39% (95% CI, 28.3% - 49.6%) in the CRT arm and 57.6% (95% CI, 46.3% - 67.4%) in \nthe NCRT arm in patients with p16 -negative oropharyngeal cancers.   \nThe analysis for 2 years  showed that nimotuzumab in combination with CRT was superior \nto CRT alone in improving the PFS. The NCRT led to a significant  increase in  the LRC and \nDFS compared to CRT alone.  \nA new analysis of the clinical data of the study was subsequently done and presented at the \nAnnual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Meeting 20 24 to \nfollow up the long -term survival  of patients in this study . The primary endpoint was a 10 -year \nOS; the key secondary endpoint was late adverse events. Intent to treat analysis was performed. \nLandmark analysis was performed to compare 10 OS between the 2 arms. COX proportional \nhazard model will be used for the calculation of ha zard ratio (HR). The adverse events between \nthe 2 arms were compared using a Fisher’s test. A p -value of 0.05 will be considered as \nsignificant. The median follow -up was 8.86 years (95% CI 8.59 -9.16).  \nThe primary site of the primary was the oropharynx (269,50.2%) and only 24 cases were \nHPV positive. The 10 -year OS was 22.5% (95% CI 16.7 -28.8) versus 33.5% (95% CI 27.6 -\n39.4) in the CRT and NCRT arm respectively (H R=0.811; 95%CI , 0.664  - 0.995 , P=0.044). \nThe median OS was 2.78 years (95% CI , 2.31 - 3.69) versus 3.69 years (95% CI , 2.90 - 4.49) \nin the CRT and NCRT arm respectively (P=0.04).  \nThe median OS in HPV negative oropharynx was 1.8 years (95% CI , 1.51-2.09) versus 2.48 \nyears (95% CI , 1.79-3.16) in the CRT and NCRT arm respectively (P=0.02; HR 0.724 95%  CI, \n0.546 -0.959).  \nLong -term adverse events were captured in 380 patients. There was no statistically \nsignificant difference in late -term adverse events between the 2 arms.  \nThis new analysis showed that t he addition of nimotuzumab to weekly cisplatin leads to \nimprovement in long -term overall survival in locally advanced HNSCC without any additional \nincrease in late -term adverse events. These results are largely applicable in HPV -negative \npatients.  \n  \n \n5.24 Study No. IIC RD EC -040 (completed, SCCHN).  \n \nPatients with unresectable advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were enrolled \nin a non -randomized, open -label, Phase I/II trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of \nnimotuzumab treatment in combination with radiotherapy. Patients were divid ed into 4 cohorts \nand were administered 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg of nimotuzumab once weekly by intravenous \ninfusion over a period of 30 minutes for 6 weeks. Radiotherapy consisted of 2 Gy doses daily, 5 \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 50 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         days/week for 6 to 7 weeks (equivalent to a total dose of 60 to 66 Gy). This trial was conducted \nin one investigation site in Cuba and it initiated in August 1999 and completed in February 2001.  \nFourteen (14) patients, 3 women and 11 men (mean age 62, range 47 -78) were enrolled in the \nstudy.  Two patients discontinued therapy prior to receiving all 6 doses of nimotuzumab and were \ntherefore not assessed for efficacy, resulting in 12 evaluable patie nts. Safety data is available for \nall 14 patients.  \nIn the safety data set of the study there was a total of 103 AEs reported in 14 patients (100%) \nduring the study period. Out of 103 AEs reported, 51 AEs reported in 11 patients (78.6%) were \nassessed as probable, possibly  or definite related to the administration of radiotherapy and \nnimotuzumab. The most common related to the study drug AEs (> 3 subjects, 21.4%) were \npyrexia (7 subjects, 50%), tremors (5 subjects, 35.7%), myalgia (4 subjects, 28.6%), anemia (3 \nsubjects, 21.4%), headache (3 subjects, 21.4%) a nd hypertension (3 subjects, 21.4%). A list of \nrelated AEs is summarized in Appendix B, Table B -24. \nThere were no SAEs reported during the period of the study and there were no \ndiscontinuations due to adverse events. Seven (7) patients died during follow -up, however, none \nof the deaths were related to nimotuzumab treatment.  \nThe clinical response was classified according to the WHO criteria as CR, PR, SD, and PD. \nImaging trials were performed before including the patient in the trial, at the end of the treatment \nwith nimotuzumab combined with radiotherapy (week 6) and then eve ry 3 months thereafter \n(months 3, 6, 9, and 12).  \nResults showed that the best therapeutic response was obtained at the highest dosage levels \n(200 and 400 mg) and due to the small sample size no statistically significant differences were \nobserved between the 200 and 400 mg doses regarding response.  \n \n5.25 Study No. IIC RD EC -046 (completed, SCCHN)  \n  \nThis was a non -randomized, open -label Phase I/II clinical trial conducted in patients with \nadvanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck to investigate the safety, efficacy, and \npharmacokinetic profile of nimotuzumab treatment in combination with r adiotherapy. Patients \nwere enrolled in one of two treatment cohorts of 5 patients each. Patients received a single dose \nof nimotuzumab (200 or 400 mg) once a week for 6 weeks, for a cumulative dose of 1200 or \n2400 mg per treatment period. Patients also rec eived concurrently either 60 or 66 Gy radiotherapy \nonce a day (5 days/week) for 6 weeks.  This study was conducted in one investigation site in \nCuba,  and it initiated in November 2000 and completed in March 2002.  \nTen (10) male patients, with a mean age of 59 years (range 46 to 68), were enrolled in the \nstudy.  \nIn the safety data  of the study there was a total of 38 AEs reported in 9 patients (90%) during \nthe study period. Out of 38 SAEs reported, 21 SAEs reported in 9 patients (90%) were assessed \nas probable, possible or definite related to the administration of radiotherapy and nimotuzumab. \nThe most common reported study drug related to  AEs (> 2 subjects, 20 %) were tremors (4 \nsubjects, 40%), anemia (3 subjects, 30%), and hematuria (2 subjects, 20%). A list of related AEs \nis provided in Appendix B, Table B -25. \nThere was 3 SAE reported in 1 patient (10%) during the study period. These 3 SAEs were \nassessed by the investigator to be related to the administration of nimotuzumab. The SAEs \nconsisted of anemia , increased blood creatinine and hematuria . A list of these related SAEs is \nsummarized in Appendix C, Table C -1. \nNo patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events. Five (5) patients died during \nfollow -up; all deaths were due to disease progression.  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 51 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         The efficacy of nimotuzumab treatment in combination with radiotherapy was evaluated using \nMRI imaging based on the NCI’s Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor s (RECIST). At \nthe time this report was prepared, 5 patients had died, 2 patients were alive and demonstrated \nCR, and the remaining 3 patients were lost to follow -up. For the patients who were lost to follow \nup, results are based on the last observation da te. \nAn objective response was obtained in 9 patients (90%): 4 CRs and 5 PRs. At the 200 mg dose \nlevel, 2 CR and 2 PR were obtained and 1 patient attained SD as his best response. At the 400 \nmg dose level, there were 2 CR and 3 PR.  \n \n5.26 Study No. IIC RD EC -076 (completed, SCCHN).  \n \nThis was a Phase I, single center study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of \nnimotuzumab in patients with advanced head and neck cancer in conjunction with radiation \ntherapy. All patients were enrolled in one investigation site in Cuba. This study initiated in \nAugust 2005 and completed in November 2006.  \nTen (10) patients were enrolled in the study. The study population consisted of 8 males and 2 \nfemales with a mean age of 63 years (range 53 to 73 years).  The patients were assigned in \nsequential manner to the two treatment groups, each receiving 8 doses o f nimotuzumab.  The \nfirst 5 patients received a 200  mg dose of nimotuzumab,  and the following 5 patients received a \n400mg dose of nimotuzumab.  \nA total of 6 a dverse events were reported in 3 patients (30%) of the 10 patients included in the \nstudy. There was a total of 6 AEs reported in 3 patients (30 %). Out of 6 AEs reported, 4 AEs in \n3 patients (30%) were assessed by the investigators to be related to the administration of \nnimotuzumab. The related AEs included pyrexia, chills and aller gy. List of related AEs are \nprovided in Appendix B, Table B -26.  \nThere were 2 SAEs reported in one patient (10%) during the study period. The SAEs were \nacute heart failure and respiratory sepsis. None of these SAEs were  assessed by the investigator \nto be related to the study drug.  \nThe combined therapy of nimotuzumab and radiation therapy resulted in objective anti -tumor \nresponse in 90% of patients.  There was no significant difference in survival time of patients \ntreated with 200 mg or 400 mg doses of nimotuzumab (medians of 12.5 months vs. 5.8 months, \nrespectively). Nimotuzumab was well tolerated in the study. The signal ing associated with \nnimotuzumab was not inhibited in the skin or in the tumor .  The proliferative activity was reduced \nafter one dose of the study drug.  No perivasc ular lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate was \nobserved in the dermis.  \n \n5.27 Study No. YMB -1000 -004 (completed, SCCHN).  \n \nThis was an open -label Phase I dose escalation study designed to assess the safety of \nnimotuzumab in conjunction with radiotherapy in patients with advanced (unresectable) \nSCCHN.  The objectives were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nimotuzumab.  Pat ients were \ntreated with radiotherapy of 70 Gy in 35 fractions plus 100 or 200 mg doses of nimotuzumab \nonce a week for 6 weeks.  This study was conducted in 6 investigation centers across Canada, \nand it initiated in October 2000 and completed in February 20 04. \nThirty -one (31) patients (26 males/5 females) were enrolled in the study with a mean age of \n59 years (range 36 to 75 years).  Fourteen (14) patients were enrolled into the 100 mg dose group,  \nand 17 patients were enrolled into the 200 mg dose group.  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 52 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         In the safety data from the study, there were 524 adverse events (AEs) reported in 27 patients \n(87.1%). Of 524 AEs reported, there were 121 AEs reported in 22 patients (71%) that were \nassessed  to be probable, possible or definite related to the administration of radiotherapy and \nnimotuzumab. The most common treatment -related AEs (> 4 subjects, 12.9%) were fatigue (7 \nsubjects, 22.6%), headache (7 subjects, 22.6%), nausea (6 subjects, 19.4%), pyr exia (5 subjects, \n16.1%) and tremors (4 subjects, 12.9%). Two (2 ) (14.3%) patients in the 100 mg group and 4 \n(23.5%) patients in the 200 mg group experienced Grade 3 or 4, treatment -related adverse events \nAll related AEs are provided in Appendix B, Table B -27. \nThere was a total of 21 SAEs reported in 7 patients (22.6%) during the study period. Out of \n21 SAEs reported, 13 SAEs reported in 3 patients (9.7%) were considered by the investigator to \nbe probable, possible or definite related to the administration of ra diotherapy and nimotuzumab. \nOne (1) (7.1%) patient in the 100 mg group and 2 (11.8%) patients in the 200 mg group had \nserious, Grade 3 or 4 events considered by the investigator related to nimotuzumab treatment \n(tremor, cyanosis NOS, vomiting NOS, dehydrat ion, rigors, pyrexia, and hypertension \naggravated). These patients recovered from the event(s) on the same day it occurred. The most \ncommon SAE related to the administration of nimotuzumab (> 2 subjects, 6.45%) were cyanosis \n(2 subjects, 6.45%), hypertensi on (2 subjects, 6.45%), nausea (2 subjects, 6.45%) and tremors (2 \nsubjects, 6.45%). A listing of SAEs is presented in Appendix C, Table C -1. \nOne (1) patient (#009) in the 200 mg group had a serious adverse event during the treatment \nperiod which resulted in death (gastrointestinal hemorrhage  NOS). This event was considered by \nthe investigator to be not related to nimotuzumab treatment and was due to progressive disease \n(bleeding in tumor ).  \nFour (4) patients in the 100 mg group and 5 patients in the 200 mg group died during the study \n(Day 0 to end of study). Most patients (8 of the 9) died of head and neck cancer, except 1 patient \nin the 100 mg group who died of unknown cause. Two (2) patient s in the 100 mg group and 6 \npatients in the 200 mg group died during the follow up period. Both patients in the 100 mg group \nincluding 1 patient in the 200 mg group died of disease progression. For the other deaths in the \n200 mg group, 3 were due to metast atic disease, 1 was due to bronchopneumonia, and 1 was due \nto anorexia which related to the presence of the disease.  \nThe efficacy of nimotuzumab was assessed by WHO criteria using computed tomography \nscans taken at 5, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 52 -weeks  post-infusion.  Follow -up of patients continued until \ndeath.  \nIn the intent -to-treat (ITT) population (N=31), a total of 18 patients (69.2%) demonstrated CR \nas the best response to treatment.  Three (3) patients (11.5%) reported PR as their best response, \n1 patient (3.8%) exhibited a mixed response, 3 patients (11.5% ) achieved SD and 1 patient (3.8%) \nexperienced PD. The median overall survival time was 829 days. The treatment target group \n(TTG) population, consisting of patients who received all 6 doses of nimotuzumab and who did \nnot withdraw from follow -up after trea tment, was also evaluated for efficacy (N=24). In this \npopulation, the best responses included 18 (75.0%) CR, 2 (8.3%) PR, 1 (4.2%) mixed tumor  \nresponse, 2 (8.3%) SD and 1 (4.2%) PD. The median overall survival time was 1302 days.  \n \n5.28 Study No. IIC RD EC -055 (completed, SCCHN).  \n \nA two -arm, randomized, placebo -controlled, multi -center Phase II/III trial was performed to \nevaluate the activity of nimotuzumab in patients with epithelial tumor s of the head and neck.  The \nprimary objective was the assessment of antitumor response of nimotuzumab or placebo in \ncombination with radiotherapy. Secondary objectives included safety, immunogenicity and \nquality of life. Patients were randomized to receiv e 6 weekly doses of placebo or nimotuzumab \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 53 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         (200 mg) in combination with 66 Gy of radiotherapy. This trial was conducted in 3 investigation \nsites in Cuba. The study initiated in July 2002 and completed enrollment in February 2007.  \nA total of 106 patients with histologically documented advanced locoregional (unresectable) \nSCCHN were included in the trial. Fifty -four (54) patients (mean age 59.48 years) were \nrandomized to the nimotuzumab + RT arm and 52 patients (mean age 65.88 years)  were \nrandomized to the placebo + RT arm.  No significant differences were detected between the two \narms regarding demography or tumor  characteristics.  \nIn the safety data set of this clinical study a total of 183 AEs was reported in 68 patients (97 \nAEs reported in 38 patients (70.4%) from the radiotherapy and nimotuzumab arm and 86 AEs \nreported in 30 patients (57.7%) in the radiotherapy and placebo arm). Out of 97 AEs reported on \nradiotherapy and nimotuzumab arm, 41 AEs reported in 17 patients (31.5%) were assessed by \nthe investigators to be probable, possibly  or definite related to the administration of radiotherapy \nand nimotuzumab. The most common related to the study drug AEs (> 3 subjects, 5.6%) were \nasthenia (5 subjects, 9.3 %), pyrexia (5 subjects, 9.3%), headache (4 subjects, 7.4%), anorexia (3 \nsubjects,  5.6 %) and chills (3 subjects, 5.6%). A list of related AEs associated with the \nadministration of radiotherapy and nimotuzumab is summarized in Appendix B, Table B -28. \nThere 8 SAEs reported in 4 patients (7.4%) from the radiotherapy plus nimotuzumab arm. Out \nof 8 SAEs, 5 SAEs reported in one patient (1.85%) were assessed by the investigator as possible, \nprobable or definite related to the treatment of radiotherapy and ni motuzumab. A listing of related \nSAEs is provided in Appendix C, Table C -1. No treatment -related deaths were observed.  \nDocumented anti -tumor response was obtained for 75 patients (37 treated with nimotuzumab \nand 38 with a placebo). Fifty -nine percent (59.5 %) of patients receiving nimotuzumab plus \nirradiation achieved complete response while only 34.2 % of the subjects treated with irradi ation \nplus a placebo were classified as complete responders. The mean and median survival of all \npatients treated in this trial was 20.31 and 11.77 months, respectively. In the intent to treat \nanalysis, the mean and the median survival of t he patients treated with nimotuzumab and RT \nwere 22.71 and 12.50 months while subjects treated with the placebo plus irradiation had a mean \nand a median of 17.71 and 9.47 months, respectively.  \n \n5.29 Study No. hR3/SCCHN/001/IND (completed, SCCHN).  \n \nThis was a multicenter, open label, randomized Phase II study designed to investigate the \nsafety and efficacy of nimotuzumab, a humanized antibody directed against EGFR in patients \nwith advanced [Stage III or IVA (T1 -T4a, N0 -N2, excluding T4b)], histologic ally documented \nSCCHN, excluding nasopharynx, in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy or \nstandard radiotherapy alone. This trial was conducted in India , and it initiated in September 2004,  \nand the 6 -month follow up period was completed in March 2 006. \nPatients were divided into 4 cohorts (23 patients/cohort), comprised of nimotuzumab \ntreatment plus radiotherapy, radiotherapy alone, nimotuzumab treatment plus radiotherapy and \nchemotherapy, and radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. Nimotuzumab treatment consist ed of a 200 \nmg dose of nimotuzumab infused over 60 minutes, administered once a week for 6 weeks. \nChemotherapy consisted of 50 mg cisplatin infused over 2 hours, administered once a week for \n6 weeks. Radiotherapy consisted of treatment with 2 Gy/day, 5 day s/week, for the 6 -week study \nperiod (equivalent to a total of 60 Gy of radiotherapy). Ninety –two (92) patients (82 males/10 \nfemales) with ages ranging from 27 to 70 years were enrolled in the study.  \nIn the safety data set for the cohort of radiotherapy plus nimotuzumab there was a total of 205 \nadverse events (AEs) reported in 22 patients (95.7%). Out of 205 AEs reported, 12 AEs reported \nin 7 patients (30.4%) were assessed by the investigators to be pr obable, possibly  or definite \nrelated to the administration of radiotherapy and nimotuzumab. The reported AEs related to the \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 54 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         administration of nimotuzumab were anaphylactic shock, chills, pyrexia, headache, pruritus, \nurticarial  and fluctuations in the blood pressure reported in 1 patient each and rash that was \nreported in 2 subjects (8.7%). A list of related AEs associated with the administration of \nradiotherapy and nimotuzumab is summarized in Appendix B, Table B -29. \nIn the safety data set for the cohort of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and nimotuzumab there \nwas a total of 241 AEs reported in 23 patients (100%) during the study period. Out of 241 AEs \nreported, 10 AEs reported in 9 patients (39.1%) were assessed as po ssible related to the \nadministration of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and nimotuzumab. These adverse events were \nmild to moderate in severity, self -limiting and reversible. Three patients experienced an infusion \nreaction during the first dose; all three patien ts recovered without sequelae and were able to \ncontinue subsequent infusions of nimotuzumab. The most common related to the study drug AEs \n(> 2 subjects, 8.7%) were vomiting (3 subjects, 13.0%), hematuria (3 subjects, 13.0%) and \ndizziness (2 subjects, 8.7%). A  list of related AEs associated with the administration of \nchemotherapy, radiotherapy and nimotuzumab is summarized in Appendix B, Table B -27. \nThere were 14 SAEs reported in 12 patients (9 SAEs reported in 8 patients (34.8%) in the \nradiotherapy and nimotuzumab arm and 5 SAEs reported in 4 patients (17.4%) in the \nchemotherapy, radiotherapy and nimotuzumab arm).  Out of 9 SAEs reported in the radio therapy \nplus nimotuzumab arm, 3 SAEs reported in 1 patient (4.3%) were assessed as definite related to \nthe administration of nimotuzumab. The SAEs consisted of a serious anaphylactic reaction with \nskin rash that was treated with symptomatic therapy and was  withdrawn from the study. A list of \nSAEs related to the administration of nimotuzumab is summarized on Appendix C, Table C -1. \nNone of SAE reported on the chemotherapy, radiotherapy and nimotuzumab arm was assessed \nby the investigator to be related to the administration of nimotuzumab.  \nThe efficacy of nimotuzumab treatment was evaluated based on response and disease \nprogression using the NCI’s RECIST criteria.  A total of sixteen patients were not evaluable for \nefficacy. One patient was lost to follow up, one patient withdrew consent, on e patient \ndiscontinued due to a nimotuzumab related infusion reaction and anaphylaxis,  and 13 patients \ndied due to progressive disease and other causes. At the end of 6 months of treatment, a \nsignificantly better response rate was observed in both nimotuzu mab treatment groups compared \nto the respective control groups.  \nAt the end of 24 weeks of treatment in the 17 patients evaluable for efficacy in the \nnimotuzumab + RT arm, 13 (76 %) patients showed an objective response (CR + PR) as \ncompared to 7 (37 %) patients in the RT arm (N=19). The difference was statistically sig nificant \nbetween the groups (p=0.023). The CR was also greater in nimotuzumab + RT (71 %) vs. 32 % \nin the RT arm (p=0.044). More patients in the RT arm [11 of 19 patients] had PD compared to \nnimotuzumab + RT [4 of 17 patients] (p=0.049). The mean Progressi on Free Survival (PFS) was \n28.5 weeks (4.2 SD) for the nimotuzumab + RT arm compared to 28 (5 SD) weeks in the RT arm \n(p=0.73). These results demonstrate that nimotuzumab + RT showed a significant tumor  response \nin both CR and objective response compared to RT alone.  \nAt the end of 24 weeks of treatment in the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy in the \nnimotuzumab + CT + RT arm, 20 patients (100%) showed a highly significant overall response \nas compared to 14 patients (70 %) in the CT + RT arm (N=20) (p<0.02). The mean p rogression \nfree survival (PFS) was not different between the nimotuzumab + CT + RT arm [31 weeks (1.5 \nSD)] compared to the CT + RT arm [30 (4.3 SD) weeks] (p<0.28).  \nIn the 60 months follow up period, there were 8 patients evaluable in the RT + nimotuzumab \narm, all 8 were still alive and 6 patients on the RT alone arm, 3 alive and 3 losses of follow up. \nThe median overall survival for the RT + nimotuzumab arm was 14.36  months, compared to \n12.78 months for the RT arm alone, with a hazard ratio (HR)  [95 % CI] = 0.761 [0.372, 1.555] \nand a p -value of 0.45. There were not statistically significant differences between the arms. There \nwere 13 evaluable patients , 9 patients sti ll alive and 4 patients loss of follow up on the CT + RT \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 55 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         + nimotuzumab arm and 6 evaluable patients, 4 patients still alive and 2 patients loss of follow \nup on the CT + RT arm. The median overall survival for the CT + RT + nimotuzumab arm had \nnot been reached and was 21.94 months for the CT + RT arm, with a HR [ 95 % CI] = 0.356 \n[0.161, 0.787], and a p -value = 0.0078. The 5 -year survival rate was 34.8 % for the RT + \nnimotuzumab arm, compared to 26.1 for the RT alone arm and was 56.5 % for the CT + RT + \nnimotuzumab compared to 26.1 % for the CT + RT arm. The differ ences were statistically \nsignificant.  \n \n5.30 Study No. CLG16/BIO009/SCCHN/hR3/2006 (completed, Head & Neck).  \n \nThis was a Phase IV, open -label, multicenter study to assess the safety and tolerability of \nnimotuzumab with standard of care (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy).

Four therapeutic \nschemes were evaluated: nimotuzumab, nimotuzumab  + Chemotherapy (Nimo  + CT), \nnimotuzumab  + Radiotherapy (Nimo  + RT) and nimotuzumab  + Chemo  + Radiotherapy (Nimo  \n+ RT/CT). Common Toxicity Criteria to Evaluate Adverse Events (AEs) (version 3.0) was used \nto classify AEs; Kaplan -Meier curves were compared by the non -parametric Log -rank metho d \nand Cox regression was applied for subgroup analyses. This study initiated in November 2012 \nand completed in November 2014. A total of 225 patients were included.  \nMost AEs were classified as grade I, AEs related to the product were reported in 36 patients. \nIn this subgroup, most frequent events were anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, anorexia, nausea, \nvomiting, asthenia and fever. In the newly diagnosed subset (n=155) , although no significant \ndifference was shown in the intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis, there was a trend toward a benefit in \nfavor of Nimo  + RT/CT . The benefit was  not just related to Progression -Free-Survival (PFS) \n(22.4 months; p=0.065), but also to Overa ll Survival (OS) (24.3 months; p=0.089), with higher \nsurvival rates at 12 and 24 months for PFS (67.3% and 46.3%, respectively) and OS (70.1% and \n50.3%, respectively), compared to the other regimens. A listing of related to study drug AEs is \nsummarized in Appendix B, Table B -32. \nThere was a total of 946 SAEs (114 SAEs on nimotuzumab arm, 66 SAEs on radiotherapy \nplus nimotuzumab arm, 112 SAEs on nimotuzumab  plus chemotherapy, and 624 SAEs on \nchemotherapy concomitant with radiotherapy and nimotuzumab arm) reported in 131 patients. \nOf the 946 SAEs reported, 117 SAEs (12.4%) were assessed by the investigators to be probable, \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 58 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         possible or definite related to the treatments. The distribution of treatment -related SAEs by study \narm was as follow: 13 SAEs reported in 7 patients (9.0% of the total of SAEs reported in this \ngroup) in the nimotuzumab arm, 11 SAEs reported in 4 patients (16.7%) on nimotuzumab plus \nradiotherapy arm, 10 SAEs in 5 patients (8.9%) on nimotuzumab plus chemotherapy arm, and \n83 SAEs in 20 patients (13.3%) on chemotherapy concomitant with radiotherapy and \nnimotuzumab arm. Of the 117 SAEs reported to be probable, possible or definitive related, only \n1 SAE in 1 patient (0.1%) was considered to be related to the treatment of nimotuzumab. Patient \nGAL -HRA -186 who experienced an anaphylactic reaction with life threatening, assessed as \nreversible after treatment interrup tion. Information on this nimotuzumab related SAE is listed in \nAppendix C, Table C -1. \nThe efficacy analysis was conducted in the newly diagnosed subset of patients (n=155). \nAlthough no significant difference was shown in the intent to treat analysis, there was a trend \ntoward a benefit in favor of the nimotuzumab + RT/CT arm, in terms of PFS  (22.4 months; \np=0.065), compared to nimotuzumab arm (9.90 months), nimotuzumab + RT (5.28 months) and \nnimotuzumab plus CT (8.89 months). A similar trend was observed for OS (24.39 months; \np=0.089), in comparison to nimotuzumab arm (11.28 months), nimotuzu mab + RT (12.62 \nmonths) and nimotuzumab + CT (10.59 months). Additionally, patients treated with \nnimotuzumab + RT/CT showed higher survival rates at 12 and 24 months for PFS (67.3% and \n46.3%, respectively) as compared to nimotuzumab arm (42.1%; 34.4%), nim otuzumab + RT \n(42.9%; 28.6%) and nimotuzumab plus CT (28.1%; 28.1%). The results suggest that \nadministration of nimotuzumab was safe and well tolerated despite combining with RT/CT in the \ntreatment of advanced HNSCC patients.  \n  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 59 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )          \n5.33 Study No. BPL -Nimo -SCCHN -RWS -1 (completed, Head and Neck).  \n \nThis was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study design based on real -world data. \nThe study was conducted in 8 public hospitals across China that use nimotuzumab injections \nrelatively intensively and collect patients who received chemoradiotherap y/radiotherapy ± \nnimotuzumab injection for the treatment of locally advanced head and neck carcinoma from \nJanuary 2015 to December 2018. Clinical data and the survival follow -up data of patients \nincluded in the study were analyzed to evaluate effectiveness  of nimotuzumab combined with \nchemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck squamous \ncell carcinoma. All individual adverse drug reactions collected in China from January 2015 to \nDecember 2018 were used for safety evalua tion. The study initiated in July 2021 and concluded \nin January 2023.  \nPatients in the study group received nimotuzumab combined with \nchemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy. Nimotuzumab was administered at least 5 times during \nradiotherapy administration ± 7 days. The control group received only \nchemoradiation/radiotherapy and nimotuzumab was not used at least 7 days before and 7 days \nafter chemoradiation/radiotherapy administration.  \nThe primary endpoint of the study was to use real-world data to evaluate the effectiveness and \nsafety of nimotuzumab combined with chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy in the treatment of \nlocally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The secondary endpoints were to \nexplore the characteristics of the patients who benefit more from nimotuzumab and discover the \nadvantageous groups. Efficacy evaluation analysis included: 3 -year overall survival (OS) rate, 3 -\nyear progression -free survival (PFS) rate, 3 -year local control (LRC) rate, objective response rate \n(ORR), and disease control rate (DCR).  \nThe original design planned to enroll  a total of 1,900 cases, with 475 cases in the study group \nand 1,425 cases in the control group , with at least 266 cases in each group a fter matching \naccording to 1:1 propensity score (PS). In fact, 2 ,250 cases , out of the 25.442 screened cases, \nwere initially introduced in t he data collection . The total number of successfully s elected cases \nwas 1,931 cases, including 308 cases in the research group and 1 .623 cases in the control group. \nAfter matching according to 1:1 propensity score  (PS), there were 612 patients included in the \nstudy, 306 cases in the study group and 306 cases in the control group. During the study, were \ncollected a total of 151 post -marketing reports were collected from the period between Januar y \n2015  and December 2018  and included in the safety analysis.  \nThe median follow -up was 51.88 (48.36~55.95) months and 54.80 (50.33~58.15) months  in \nthe experimental group and the control group,  respectively. The study group had 96 death events , \nand the control group had 117 death events. The median survival time (OS) of both groups was \nnot reach ed during the study . The 3 -year OS rate of the nimotuzumab group was 74.6%, and \n63.3%  in the control group ( non-stratified Log -rank test, P=0.038, using the non -stratified Cox \nproportional hazards model, the HR (95% CI) was 0.7 5 (0.57 – 0.99) . \nThe median PFS of the study group increased 10.91 months compared to the control group \n(40.77 months vs 29.86 months). (non-stratified Log -rank test, P=0.021), using cloglog \ntransformation P=0.009, HR (95% CI) = 0.74 ; (0.58 – 0.96); therefore, with a 26% of reduction \nin risk progression in the nimotuzumab group. The 3 -year PFS rate of the nimotuzumab group \nwas 57.7%, and the 3 -year PFS rate of the control group was 44.3%  \nThe 3 -year LRC rate of nimotuzumab group and the control group were similar (95.7% vs \n93.9%), non -stratified Log -rank test p=0.560; using clolog transformation method: p=0.540, HR \n(95% CI) = 0.72 (0.25, 2.14).  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 60 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         The ORR of the study nimotuzumab and the control group were similar (51.0% vs 51.0% \n(p=1.00). The DCR of the nimotuzumab group and the control group were similar (57.2% vs \n55.9%. The nimotuzumab group was 1.3% non -significantly higher than the control grou p (p =   \n0.744).  \nFrom January 1, 2015,  to December 31, 2018, a total of 24,976 cases were expected to receive \nnimotuzumab, based on sales data . A total of 151 (0.6%) post -marketing adverse reaction reports \nwere received from  patients using nimotuzumab, and 146 (0.6%)  were r elated to the drug . The \nmain adverse reactions were systemic diseases and various reactions at the site of  administration \n(69 cases, 0.3%) and gastrointestinal system dis orders  (19 cases, 0. 1%), chills (31 cases, 0.1%), \nfever (17 cases, 0.1%) . A listing of related  study drug AEs is summarized in Appendix B, Table \nB-33.  \nIn addition, a total of 5 7 cases (0.2%) were reported as serious adverse reactions related to the \ntreatment, among them, 5 3 cases (0.2%) were reported to be related to nimotuzumab. Information \non these nimotuzumab related SAE is listed in Appendix C, Table C -1. \nIn summary, post-matching data analysis from this study shows that nimotuzumab combined \nwith concurrent chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy is effective in the treatment of locally advanced \nhead and neck cancer. Patients treated with nimotuzumab had significant survival  benefits  and a \nbetter 3 -year PFS compared to control group. No significant differences were observed for 3 -\nyear LRC, ORR and DCR  between nimotuzumab and the control group. Safety results indicate \nthat nimotuzumab has a favorable safety profile.  \n \n \n5.34 Study No. IIC RD EC -084 (completed, Hepatic Carcinomas).  \n \nThis was a Phase I, open -label, single arm, escalating dose safety study of immune -\nchemoembolization using nimotuzumab in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma to determine \nthe maximum tolerated dose or optical biological dose of nimotuzumab to be used fo r immune -\nchemoembolization. Fifteen  patients received 50, 100, 200 or 400 mg of nimotuzumab in \ncombination with 25 to 50 mg/m2 of doxorubicin and 10 mL lipidol by intra-arterial  \nadministration. Primary endpoint was to determine maximum tolerated dose and s econdary \nendpoint were overall response rate, overall survival and duration of the response. This study \nwas initiated in April 2007 and completed in July 2009.   \nA total of 15 patients were included, 3 patients at the dose of 50 mg, 3 at 100 mg, 8 at 200 mg \nand 1 patient at 400 mg dose of nimotuzumab.  \nA total of 25 adverse events in 6 patients were reported independent of the causality. Of the \n25 events, there were 12 events (48.0 %) associated with the administration of doxorubicin, 5 \n(20.0 %) associated with the arteriographic procedure, 2 (8.0 %) wit h the embolization, 1 (4.0 \n%) associated with nimotuzumab, 2 (8.0 %) other causes and 2 (8.0 %) no related to the \nadministered drugs. Only in 1 event was the causality  assessed as possible or probable related to \nthe study drug which was a cutaneous rash in one patient. The most frequently reported AEs, \nregardless of relationship to the study drug, were anorexia, hematoma on the injection site and \nhematuria. See Appendix B, Table B -34 for a listing of related AEs. No serious adverse events \nwere reported.  \nAfter a single dose of 50, 100, 200 or 400 mg of nimotuzumab in combination with \ndoxorubicin via intraarterial administration the overall survival of the patients was 13.01 months.  \n \n5.35 Study No. 2002SL0008 (completed, Nasopharyngeal).  \n \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 61 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         This was a Phase II randomized, open -label, multi -center trial that recruited patients with \nlocally advanced nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas from 7 centers in China.  The safety \nand short -term efficacy of nimotuzumab treatment was assessed as an ad junctive therapy to \nradiotherapy.  A total of 137 patients were enrolled in the study and were divided into 2 cohorts \ncomprised of nimotuzumab treatment plus radiotherapy (n = 70), or radiotherapy alone (n = 67).  \nNimotuzumab treatment consisted of a 100 m g dose of nimotuzumab administered once a week \nfor 8 weeks concomitantly with radiotherapy, which consisted of 2 Gy doses administered daily, \n5 days/week (equivalent to a total of 70 to 76 Gy of radiotherapy).  This trial was conducted \nbetween August 2002 and October 2004.  \nA total of 137 patients ranging in age from 18 to 70 years, were enrolled in the study.  Of these \npatients, 126 were included in the Per Protocol (PP) population (all protocol -compliant patients), \nand 130 were in the ITT population. All patients were asses sed for safety.  \nIn the safety data set (N=137), the most common adverse reaction related to nimotuzumab \nwas fever, with an incidence of 4.28 %. The highest temperature as recorded was 39 ºC, which \nresolved with the administration of antipyretics. Dizziness and hypotension  were observed in \n2.86 % of patients, with the lowest pressure documented at 80/50 mmHg. Skin rash and nausea, \neach observed in 1.43 % of patients, were mild and resolved spontaneously. These nimotuzumab -\nrelated adverse events were all generally mild in se verity. A list of related AEs is provided in \nAppendix B, Table B -35. No serious adverse events were reported.  \nThe efficacy of treatment with nimotuzumab was assessed at the end of the treatment period, \nand again at 5 and 17 weeks after the end of treatment using the WHO criteria to evaluate tumor  \nresponse. No additional cancer treatments were administered during this evaluation period.  \nOverall, the complete response rate was significantly better in the nimotuzumab group plus \nradiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone at the end of the treatment period and 5 and 17 \nweeks after the end of treatment.  Overall respon se, which includes both complete response and \npartial response rates, was also significantly better in the nimotuzumab group compared to the \nradiotherapy group [100 % in the nimotuzumab group in both the ITT and PP populations, \ncompared to 92.31 % and 90.9 1 % in the radiotherapy group (PP and ITT, respectively)].  \nAdditionally, distant metastases were evaluated at 17 weeks post -treatment and were detected in \n5 control patients, but in only 1 nimotuzumab -treated patient.  The difference, however, was not \nstatistically significant due to the low number of patients and short follow -up period.  \n \n \n5.36 Study No. BT-CT-001 (completed, Nasopharyngeal).  \n \nThis was a  randomized, double -blinded controlled, and multicenter phase III clinical trial. \nPatients included had histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced NPC, staging III or \nIVa according to China NPC staging system 2008 version and with measurable primary tumor, \naged 18 -70 years, Karnofsky performance status (KPS)>70, more than 6 months survival time \nand enough organ function. All patients were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive nimotuzumab \nplus chemo -radiotherapy (intensity -modulated radiation therapy or conformal radiotherapy), \ncisplatin, three cycles) (arm A) or placebo plus chemo -radiotherapy (arm B ).  \nThe primary endpoint of the study was overall survival (OS) rate at 5 years. Secondary \nendpoints included the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), 3 -year distant \nmetastasis rate (DMR), 3 -year disease -free survival (DFS), 3 -year loco -regional control (LRC) \nrate and safety.  \nA total of 482 patients in 24 study sites were enrolled (361 in arm A vs. 121 in arm B) from \nOctober 30, 2009, to January 25, 2022 . The entire study was divided into two phases. The first \nphase summarized the local tumor control rate and safety within 4 months after the subject's \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 62 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         enrollment, treatment and treatment completion. This period started when subjects signed the \ninformed consent form (entering the screening period) and finished 4 months after the treatment \nended. The second stage was a regular follow -up observation to summ arize long -term \nobservation indicators. The time limit was considered when the last patient was followed up for \n5 years after enrollment.  \nIn both groups, patients received radiation therapy concurrent with Cisplatin -based \nchemotherapy. Radiation therapy was administered either as intensity -modulated radiation \ntherapy (IMRT) or conventional conformal radiation therapy (CRT). IMRT in patients with \nnasopharynx cancer were radiated 30 -34 times, 2.20 -2.30Gy/time, once a day, 5 days a week, for \n6-7 weeks. GTV: 66 -78.2Gy, CTV1: 60 -64Gy, CTV2: 54 -60Gy. Patients with neck cancer, node -\npositive, were radiated GTV total dose 60 -70Gy, once a day, 5 days a week, for 6 to 7 weeks, \nwhile node -negative patients received a CTV total dose 50 -55Gy, once a day, 5 days a week, for \n6 to 7 weeks. For CRT modality, patients with nasopharynx cancer received a total dose of 70 -\n(76-80) Gy, 35 -(38-40) fractions, 2Gy/fraction, once a day, 5 days/week, for 6 -8 weeks. If there \nwas residual disease at the end of treatment, the dose was increased as appropriate. For patients \nwith neck cancer, lymph node positive: 64 -70Gy, 32 -35 fractions, 2Gy/fraction, once a day, 5 \ndays/week,  for 6 -7 weeks. In the lymph node negative subgroup, 50 -56Gy, 25 -28 fractions, \n2Gy/fraction, once a day, 5 days/week, for 5 -6 weeks.  \nChemotherapy was administered according to the individual differences in the patient's \ntolerance to cisplatin, one of the following two chemotherapy regimens was selected. The first \ncisplatin dose was guaranteed to reach 100 mg/m2, and the cisplatin administration method of \neach cycle before and after is consistent: (1). Cisplatin (DDP): 100 mg/m2, given once a day, 21 \ndays as a cycle, for 2 to 3 cycles, started simultaneously with radiotherapy, or (2). DDP: total \ndose 100 mg/m2, administered in 3 divided d oses, 21 days as a cycle, for 2 to 3 cycles, started \nsimultaneously with radiotherapy.  \nIn addition, patients were randomized to receive either nimotuzumab injection \n(Taixinsheng®) or placebo. Nimotuzumab was administered in the experimental arm as \nintravenous infusion, 200 mg/ week, once a week for 7 -8 weeks.  \nIn the F ull Analysis Set (FAS)  population, the median follow -up time for the experimental \ngroup and the control group was 75.7 (74.1 -78.2) months and 73.6 (71.4 -75.9) months, \nrespectively. The median survival time of both groups was not reached.  \nThe 5 -year overall survival (OS) rate of the experimental group was 76.9% (72.2% -80.9%), \nand that of the control group was 64.3% (55.1% -72.2%), meaning the addition of nimotuzumab \nto CCRT provided 12.6% absolute survival benefit at 5 -year (p=0.042; HR=0.64 6; 95% CI: \n0.449 -0.928) , P=0.018 . The risk of death in the experimental group was 35% lower than that in \nthe control group, which was statistically significant.  \nIn the Per Protocol Set (PPS) population, the 5 -year OS rate in the experimental group was \n74.7% (69.3% -79.4%), and in the control group it was 64.3% (54.0% -72.9%, meaning 10.4% \nhigher in the experimental group, compared to the control group (p= 0.183). The difference was \nclinically significant but not statistically significant. The inconsistency of results between the \nPPS population and the FAS population may  be related to the low statistical power caused by the \n3:1 randomization and the low sample size of  the PPS population. The results of survival analysis \nare usually based on the results of the FAS population.  \nSecondary endpoints of the study were not met, since the objective response rate, disease \ncontrol rate, 5 -year disease -free survival and 3 -year loco -regional recurrence free survival were \nnot significantly different between two arms.  \nIn the FAS population, 207 cases of complete remission (CR), 109 cases of partial remission \n(PR), 8 cases of stable disease (SD), 6 cases of progressive disease (PD), and 31 cases of \nunevaluable (NE) were observed in the experimental group, while 55 cases of CR, 50 cases of \nPR, 5 cases of SD, 2 cases of PD, and 9 cases of NE were observed in the control group. The \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 63 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         ORRs of the two groups were 87.5% and 86.8%, respectively, with no statistically significant \ndifference (P= 0.828) . Only the CRR showed statistical difference between the two groups. The \nCRR of the experimental group and the control group were 57.3% and 45.5%, respectively, \nwhich was 11.8% higher than that of the control group  (P=0.023).   \nThe DCRs of the experimental and control groups were 89.8% and 90.9%, respectively, with \nno statistically significant difference (P =0.713).  \nThe median disease -free survival (DFS) of the experimental group was 50.6 (44.5 -60.7) \nmonths, and that of the control group was 42.6 (34.1 -49.6) months, which was 8 months longer \nin the experimental group than in the control group. The 3 -year DFS rates of t he experimental \ngroup and the control group were 65.1% (58.7% -70.8%) and 60.3% (49.3% -69.8%), \nrespectively, which was 4.8% higher in the experimental group than in the control group. The 5 -\nyear DFS rates were 40.9% (28.0% -51.8%) and 14.4% (1.3% -42.1%) res pectively, which was \n25.6% higher , with no statistically significant difference between the two groups ( P=0.192 ). \nThe median local regional recurrence -free survival (LRFS)  in both groups was not reached. \nThe 3 -year LRFS rates in the experimental group and the control group were 94.0% (89.4% -\n96.6%) and 94.6% (86.1% -98.0%), respectively. The 5 -year LRFS rates were 93.0% (89.4% -\n96.6%) and 94.6% (86.1% -98.0%), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference \nbetween the two groups  (P=0.804 ). \nA total of 446 patients underwent distant metastasis rate ( DMR ) analysis in the study, \nincluding 335 in the experimental group and 111 in the control group. The results showed that \n60 subjects in the experimental group had distant metastasis, accounting for 17.9%, and 17 \nsubjects in the control group had DMR, accounti ng for 15.3%. There was no statistically \nsignificant difference between the two groups (P>0.05).  \nA total of 482 patients were included in the safety analysis, including 361 patients in the \nexperimental group and 121 patients in the control group. Treatment -related adverse events \n(TEAEs) occurred in 359 patients (99.4%) in the experimental group and 12 0 patients (99.2%) \nin the control group. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred in 129 patients (35.7%) in the \nexperimental group and 51 patients (42.1%) in the control group. Serious adverse events (SAEs) \noccurred in 10 patients (2.8%) in the experimental  group and no patients in the control group.  \nSerious adverse reactions related to the drug (SADRs) occurred in 1 patient (0.3 %) in the \nexperimental group and no patients in the control group. TEAEs that led to reduction or \nsuspension of administered drugs occurred in 7 patients (1.9 %) in the experi mental group and 4 \npatients (3.3 %) in the control group. ADRs that led to reduction of the experimental drug or \nsuspension of treatment occurred in 4 patients (1.1%) in the experimental group and 2 patients \n(1.7 %) in the control group. TEAEs that led to withdrawal from the trial occurred in 10 patients \n(2.8%) in the experimental group and 1 patient (0.8 %) in the control group. ADRs that led to \nwithdrawal from the trial occurred in 2 patients (0.6 %) in the experimental group and no patients \nin the control group. TEAEs that led to death occurred in 4 patients (1.1 %) in the experimental \ngroup and no patients in the control group. No patient experienced an ADR that led to death. The \nincidence of each adverse ev ent was similar between the experimental group and the control \ngroup, with no significant difference (P>0.05).  \nIn terms of severity, the incidence of TEAEs was similar between the experimental and the \ncontrol group. T he incidence of grade 1 -2 TEAEs was 99.4% vs 99.2% in the trial group and the \ncontrol group , respectively ; and 82.8% vs 81.8% for grade 3 -5 TEAEs . The incidence of grade \n1-2 ADRs was 33.8% vs 41.3%; while the incidence of grade 3 -5 ADRs was 17.7% vs 15.7% in \nthe experimental and the control group , respectively . There was no significant difference in \nseverity between the two groups.  \nA total of 353 patients in the experimental group (97.8%) had adverse reactions of various \nexaminations, while 119 patients in the control group (98.3 %) had adverse reactions.  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 64 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         The most common adverse events in the experimental arm were those related to \ngastrointestinal diseases, observed in 341 patients (94.5 %), various injuries, poisonings and \nsurgical complications, observed in 300 patients (83.1%), and metabolic and nutritional \ndisorders, observed in 160 patients (44.3%). The most common adverse events in the control \ngroup were not statistical difference to the  experimental arm , and includ ed as the most common, \ngastrointestinal diseases, reported in 114 patients (94.2%), vari ous injuries, poisoning and \nsurgical complications, in 94 patients (77.7%) and metabolic and nutritional disorders, in 56 \npatients (46.3%).  A more detailed list of related AEs is provided in Appendix B, Table B -36. \nTreatment -related adverse events ( TEAEs ) with a higher  incidence (≥40%) included \ndecreased lymphocyte count, decreased white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, nausea, \nvomiting, radiation oral mucositis, pharyngeal radiation damage.  \nAdverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) with an incidence of ≥5% include decreased white blood cell \ncount, decreased lymphocyte count, increased alanine aminotransferase, decreased neutrophil \ncount, decreased hemoglobin, increased aspartate aminotransferase, decreased platelet count, \nradiation oral mucositis.  The incidence of each adverse reaction was similar in the two groups, \nand the difference was not statistically significant.  \nA total of 10 serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred, all in the trial group. Reported SAEs \nwere reported according to system organ classification as, 3 cases (0.8%) of vascular and \nlymphatic diseases; 2 cases (0.6%) of respiratory system, chest and medias tinal diseases 1 case \n(0.3%) of infection and infestation diseases, various nervous system diseases, mental illness, \nsystemic diseases and various reactions at the administration site, pregnancy, puerperium and \nperinatal conditions  (See Appendix C, Table C -1 for a complete listing of possibly related \nSAEs) .    \nThe results of the study showed that nimotuzumab combined with concurrent \nchemoradiotherapy has a better therapeutic effect than concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone in \nthe treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with a higher 5 -year overall \nsurvival (OS) rate of 12.6%, a 35% reduction in the risk of death, and an 11.8% increase in the \ncomplete remission rate. It terms of safety, nimotuzumab combined with synchronous \nchemoradiotherapy was safe and well tolerated.  \n \n5.37 Study No. YMB -1000 -010 (completed, Phase I in NSCLC).  \n \nA Phase I, single -arm, open -label, multicenter, and multi -national clinical study in patients \nwith NSCLC unfit to chemotherapy was performed in 3 study sites in Canada and 1 site in South \nKorea. Primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the \nadministration of nimotuzumab with palliative radiation in subjects who were unsuitable for \nradical therapy (curative intent chemoradiation) and secondary endpoints included the selection \nof optimal biologicall y effective dose (BED), to assess overall clinical benefit rate, overall \nresponse rate, time to progression, progression free survival and QoL.  The study was initiated in \nMarch 2006 and completed in August 2008.  \nA total of 33 patients were included in the study;  11 patients received 100 mg of nimotuzumab, \n12 patients received 200 mg, and 10 patients received 400 mg of nimotuzumab by i.v . infusion \nin combination with 30 -36 Gy radiotherapy. The mean age of the patients was 71.5 years  (range \n45-87). Disease stage was classified as IV in 16 patients (48.5 %) and IIIB in 14 (42.4 %).  \nTreatment -emergent adverse events were experienced in all subjects of the study. In general, \nthe most frequently reported AEs regardless of relationship to the study drug, were fatigue (57.6 \n%), anorexia (51.5 %), lymphopenia (42.4 %), cough (39.4 %), dizz iness and dyspnea (36.4 %) \nand nausea and chills (33.3 %) and overall,  the most common treatment -related adverse events \nwere fatigue (42.4 %), anorexia (36.4 %), and lymphopenia (30.3 %).

Grade 3 and 4 adverse events included lymphopen ia in 5 subjects (15.2 %), \ndyspnea in 3 (9.1 %) and hyperglycemia in 2 (6.1 %). See Appendix B, Table B -37 for a \ncomplete listing of related AEs.  \nA total of 11 deaths were reported, 2 during the study and 9 died during the survival follow -\nup period. Fourteen patients (42.4 %) experienced SAEs and 1 died due to the SAE that was \nassessed as unlikely related to the study drug. See Appendix C, Table C -1 for a complete listing \nof possibly related SAEs.  \nOut of 33 patients, on the target lesions 14 subjects had partial response (42.4 %) and 12 (36.3 \n%) had stabilization of the disease, and for the non -target lesions, there were 2 complete \nresponses (6.1 %), 6 partial responses (18.2 %), 15 progressions of the disease (45.5 %) and 10 \nmissing data (30.3 %).  \nThe median progression -free survival was 25.1 weeks in the 100 mg group, 20.7 weeks in the \n200 mg group and 37.4 weeks in the 400 mg group.  \n \n5.38 Study No. YMB -1000 -010 (terminated early, Phase II in NSCLC).  \n \nA Phase II, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, multicenter clinical study in patients with \nNSCLC unfit to chemotherapy was performed in 11 clinical sites in Canada, 1 site in United \nStates, 1 in Singapore, and 1 in South Korea. No subject was enrolled in the US or Singaporean \nsites. Primary endpoints of the study were to compare overall survival in subject diagnosed with \nlocally advanced non -metastatic NSCLC who are unsuitable for radical therapy or metastatic \nNSCLC who required radiotherapy to chest disea se, receiving nimotuzumab with palliative \nradiation vs placebo – palliative radiation alone and secondary endpoint were to assess the local \nand overall response rates of nimotuzumab in combination with palliative radiation vs placebo \npalliative radiation i n patients with NSCLC stage IIB, III and IV, to assess overall clinical benefit, \nto compare progression -free survival and QoL. The study was initiated in March 2009 and was \nearly terminated because of the slow inclusion rate of the patients in June 2011.  \nPatients were administered 200 mg of nimotuzumab or placebo once a week for 8 weeks. \nRadiotherapy was administered on 3 Gy daily for 5 days a week for 2 weeks to a total of 30 Gy \n(up to an additional 6 Gy in 2 fractions could also be added). If local contr ol was achieved  after \nthe initial 8 doses, 200 mg of nimotuzumab or placebo would continue  a weekly regimen until \ndisease progression, or unacceptable toxicity.  \nA total of 51 patients were administered at least one dose of study drug, 28 patients received \nplacebo and 23 nimotuzumab.  \nTreatment -emergent adverse events were experienced by all patients in the study. The most \ncommon adverse events regardless of relationship to the study drug in all patients were fatigue \n(58.8 %), nausea (41.2 %), dyspnea (39.2 %), decreased appetite (37.3 %), dysphagia (35.3 %), \nconstipation (33.3 %), and chest pain (33.3 %) and the most common treatment -related adverse  \nevents were fatigue (45.1 %), nausea (23.5 %), and decreased appetite (21.6 %). There were  \ngrade 3 or more adverse events reported on 58.8 % of the cases. See Appendix B, Table B -38 \nfor a complete listing of related AEs.  \nA total of 9 deaths were reported during the study, 8 on the placebo arm and 1 on nimotuzumab \narm. Eight patients on the nimotuzumab arm experienced SAE and 1 died to the SAE.

The primary objective was \nto de termine the objective response rate. Secondary objectives include assessment of overall \nsurvival and progression free survival. The study was initiated in June 2008 and completed in \nMarch 2010.  \nThe study enrolled 110 patients.  Fifty -three (53) patients (12 females and 41 males) with a \nmean age of 58.2 years (range 29 to 73 years) received nimotuzumab and 57 patients (12 females \nand 45 males) with the mean age of 55.6 years (range 32 to 77 years)  were randomized to the \ncontrol group.   \nOverall, 43 (81.1%) patients in the nimotuzumab arm reported at least one AE compared to \n47 (82.5 %) patients in the control arm. The majority of nimotuzumab AEs were mild to moderate \nin severity.  The most commonly reported nimotuzumab -related AEs were vo miting (5.7%), \ndiarrhea (3.8 %), fatigue (3.8 %), pain (3.8 %) and rash (3.8 %). See Appendix B, Table B -39 \nfor a listing of AEs.  \nOf the 110 subjects enrolled, 15 (28.3 %) patients in the nimotuzumab arm and 26 (45.6 %) \npatients in the control arm reported at least one SAE.  Two SAEs were considered related to \nnimotuzumab: febrile neutropenia and gastroenteritis. See Appendix C, Table C -1 for a list of \nrelated SAEs.  \nIn the ITT population, the objective response rate was 54.0% [95% CI: 40.2 – 67.8] in the \nnimotuzumab arm and 34.5 % [95% CI: 22.0 – 47.1] in the control arm; p=0.0448. Median \noverall survival was assessed as 10.1 months [95% CI: 8.1 – 13.6] in the nimotuz umab arm and \n10.4 months [95% CI: 7.4 to 13.7] in the ITT population; p=0.475. Progression free survival was \nalso similar between arms, with a result of 4.9 month [95% CI: 4.5 – 6.9] in the nimotuzumab \narm compared to 4.8 months [95% CI: 2.8 – 5.8] in the control arm.  \n \n5.40 Study No. DE766 -A-J202 (completed, NSCLC stage III).  \n \nThis was an open -label, single arm, multicenter, Phase II study of nimotuzumab in \ncombination with cisplatin/vinorelbine and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy in patients with \nunresectable stage III non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients were administ ered i.v . \ninfusion of nimotuzumab at 200 mg dose once a week from d1 for 16 weeks together with \nchemotherapy consisting  of cisplatin (80 mg/m2, d1) and vinorelbine (20 mg/m2, d1 and 8) every \n28 days for 4 cycles and radiotherapy consisted of conventionally  fractionated  irradiation of 2 \nGy/day (5 days a week) from d1 for 6 weeks. Primary endpoint was to evaluate the tolerability \nof nimotuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin/vinorelbine) and concurrent \nthoracic radiotherapy in patients with unresectable stage  III NSCLC and secondary endpoint \nwere to evaluate the safety profile of nimotuzumab and the efficacy based on response rate, \ndisease control rate, progression -free survival, progression -free survival rate and overall survival  \nrate, to evalua te the immunogenicity (HAHA response), pharmacokinetic profile and biomarkers \nassociated with efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab. This study started in June 2009 and was \ncompleted in June 2015.  \nA total of 40 patients were enrolled on this study and 39 of them (34 males  (87.2 %) and 5 \nfemales (12.8 %)) with a median age of 62.0 years received at least one dose of the study drug. \nSixteen (16) subjects (41.0 %) had squamous cell carcinoma, 14 subjects (35.9 %) had \nadenocarcinoma, and 9 subjects (23.1 %) had other types of NSCLC, other than squamous cell \ncarcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Twenty -one (21) subjects (53.8 %) had stage IIIA NSCLC,  and \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 67 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         18 subjects (46.2 %) had stage IIIB NSCLC , and 25 subjects (64.1 %) had baseline ECOG PS 0 \nand 14 subjects (35.9 %) ECOG PS 1.  \nIn the safety analysis set there were 39 patients. These patients experienced a total of 655 \nadverse events (AEs) reported in all 39 patients (100 %). The most frequently reported AEs (> \n27 patients, 70.0 %) regardless of relationship to the study drug, were neutrophil count decreased \n(38 subjects, 97.4 %) , white blood cell count decreased (38 subjects, 97.4 %), radiation \nesophagitis (35 subjects, 89.7 %), decreased appetite (33 subjects, 84.6 %), nausea (33 subjects, \n84.6 %), radiation pneumonitis (32 subj ects, 82.1 %) and constipation (30 subjects, 76.9 %). Of \nthe 655 AEs that occurred on the treated patients, 376 were not related and 279 AEs (42.6 %) in \nall 39 patients (100 %) were reported to be related to the study drug. The most common study -\ndrug relat ed AEs (> 10 patients, 25.6 %) were neutrophil count decreased (17 subjects, 43.6 %), \nwhite blood cell count decreased (17 subjects, 43.6 %), nausea (13 subjects, 33.3 %), anemia (12 \nsubjects, 30.8 %), decreased appetite (12 subjects, 30.8 %), fatigue (11 subjects, 28.2 %) and \nconstipation (10 subjects, 25.6 %). See Appendix B, Table B -40 for a listing of all related \nadverse events.  \nSerious adverse events were reported in 4 subjects (10.3 %). Of these 4 patients, a total of 6 \nSAEs were reported. Most common SAEs reported to be related to study drug were hepatic \nfunction abnormal (1 subject, 2.6 %), radiation pneumonitis (1 subject, 2.6 %), febrile \nneutropenia (1 subject, 2.6 %) and nausea, vomiti ng and diarrhea reported on the same patient. \nSee Appendix C, Table C -1 for a complete listing of possibly related SAEs. There were 4 \npatients (10.3 %) who died during the course of the study. In no case, did the investigator \nassociate a causal relationship between the death of a patient and the application of the study \ndrug.  \nThere were 4 complete remissions  (CR) on the study (10.3 %), 23 partial remissions (59.0 %) \nand 10 stable disease (25.6 %). The overall response rate (ORR) [95 % CI] was 69.2 % [52.4, \n83.0 %] and the disease control rate (DCR) [95 % CI] was 94.9 % [82.7, 99.4 %]. The progression \nfree sur vival rates [95 % CI] at 1 -year and 5 -year were 55.3 % [38.3, 69.4 %] and 29.0 % [15.7, \n43.7 %], respectively and survival rates [95 % CI] at 1 -year and 5 -years were 87.2 % [71.9, 94.5 \n%] and 58.4 % [41.3, 72.1 %], respectiv ely. \n \n5.41 Study No. DE766 -A-J303 (terminated early, Phase III in NSCLC stage III).  \n \nA Phase III, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter clinical study in \npatients with NSCLC stage III was performed in 63 clinical sites in Japan. The study was \ndesigned to compare the efficacy of nimotuzumab, cisplatin, vinorelbine, and t horacic radiation \ntherapy versus placebo, cisplatin, vinorelbine, and thoracic radiation therapy in patients with \nunresectable locally advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma.  The primary endpoint was overall \nsurvival (OS), and secondary endpoints were prog ression -free survival (PFS), local control \nperiod, response rate, stable disease (SD), safety and exploratory biomarker analysis. Patients \nwere recruited into 2 arms . On the treatment arm , patients were administered i.v . infusion of \nnimotuzumab at 200 mg dose once a week from d1 for 16 weeks together with chemotherapy  \nand radiation . Chemotherapy  consisted of cisplatin (80 mg/m2, d1) and vinorelbine (20 mg/m2, \nd1 and 8) every 28 days for 4 cycles  and r adiotherapy consisted of conventionally fractionated  \nirradiation of 2 Gy/day (5 days a week) from d1 for 6 weeks . On the control arm , patients were \nadministered placebo once a week from day 1 for 16 weeks together with chemotherapy  and \nradiation . Chemotherapy  consisted of cisplatin (80 mg/m2, d1) and vinorelbine (20 mg/m2, d1 \nand 8) every 28 days for 4 cycles and radiotherapy consisted of conventionally fractionated  \nirradiation of 2 Gy/day (5 days a week) from d1 for 6 weeks.

After \npremature termination of the study last patient was followed up until June 2014.  \nA total of 102 patients were recruited on the study,  and 97 patients were administered the \nstudy drug, 48 patients (43 male and 5 female) with a mean age of 65.6 years were randomized \nto the treatment arm and 49 patients (45 male and 4 female) with a mean age of 62.3 years were \nrandomized to the control arm . \nIn the safety data set, there were 97 patients. Of  them , 48 patients were from the treatment \narm and 49 patients from the control that received treatment. A total of 2284 adverse events were \nreported, 1168 AEs on the nimotuzumab arm (N=48), of them 851 not related and 317 AEs in 41 \n(85.4 %) patients were report ed to be related to the study drug and 1116 AEs in the control arm \n(N=49), of them 752 not related to radiotherapy, cisplatin and vinorelbine and 364 AEs in 34 \n(69.4 %) patients were reported to be re lated to radiotherapy, cisplatin and vinorelbine. The most \ncommon study drug related AEs (> 8 patients, 16.67 %) were anemia (8 subjects, 16.67 %), \nanorexia (13 subjects, 27.08 %), constipation (10 subjects, 20.83 %), leukopenia (10 subjects, \n20.83 %), nau sea (14 subjects, 29.17 %), neutropenia (9 subjects, 18.75 %), radiation esophagitis \n(9 subjects, 18.75 %) and radiation pneumonitis (15 subjects, 31.25 %). See Appendix B, Table \nB-41 for a listing of all related adverse events.  \nThere was a total of 36 serious  adverse events (SAEs) reported in 24 patients, 9 SAEs from \nthe control arm reported in 8/49 (16.3 %) patients and 27 SAEs from nimotuzumab plus \nradiotherapy, cisplatin and vinorelbine arm reported in 16/48 (33.3 %) patients. Of the 27 SAEs, \nreported on th e nimotuzumab arm, 15 SAEs in 11/48 (22.9 %) patients were reported to be related \nto the study drug. Most common SAEs reported to be related to study drug were radiation \npneumonitis (5 subjects, 10.4 %) and lung infection (3 subjects, 6.25 %).  \nOf 97 patients who received treatment, there were 4 subjects who died due to adverse events , \nand they were considered TRDs. These TRDs were reported in nimotuzumab group. Adverse \nevents considered related to death were pneumonia, radiation pneumonitis, lung infection \n(pulmonary suppuration), and hemoptysis. See Appendix C, Table C -1 for a complete listing of \npossibly related SAEs.  \n \n5.42 Study No. IIC RD EC -079 (completed, Brain Metastases from NSCLC).  \n \nThis was a randomized, multicenter and open -label Phase II clinical trial conducted in patients \nwith brain metastases from non -small cell lung cancer. The objectives of the study included \nassessment of disease control rate, duration of response and surviva l. Patients were randomized \nto receive whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in combination with nimotuzumab or WBRT alone. \nRadiotherapy was administered in daily 2 Gy fractions to a total dose of 40 Gy and nimotuzumab \n(200 mg) was administered weekly by intrave nous infusion until disease progression. This study \nwas conducted in 5 investigation centers in Cuba. The study initiated in September 2006 and \ncompleted in December 2008.  \nAnalysis was performed on 27 patients (20 males/7 females) with a mean age of 56.37 years \n(range 41 to 80) who were enrolled in the study. Of these patients, 14 were evaluable for efficacy \nand 26 were assessed for safety. Fourteen (14) patients were random ized to receive nimotuzumab \nplus WBRT and the remaining 13 received WBRT alone.  \nA total of 152 adverse events in 19 patients were reported. From then 120 AEs were associated \nwith the treatment arm and 32 AEs to the control arm. Related AEs were reported in 1 patient in \nthe nimotuzumab + WBRT group, who experienced mild mucositis. A li st of related AEs is \nprovided in Appendix B, Table B -42. No other nimotuzumab -related AEs were reported.  \nThere were 5 serious adverse events reported in 2 patients during the course of the study. Both \npatients were enrolled in the nimotuzumab + WBRT arm of the study, however, all SAEs were \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 69 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         assessed as unrelated to nimotuzumab. Twenty (20) patients died during  the study, primarily due \nto worsening of the patient’s underlying disease and not attributed to study treatment.  \nEight (8) patients in the nimotuzumab + WBRT group were evaluable for efficacy,  and an \nadditional 6 patients were efficacy -evaluable in the control group. In the nimotuzumab + WBRT \narm, the disease control rate (CR + PR + SD), median duration of response and median survival \nwere 87.5%, 4.53 months and 4.17 months, respectively. Simil arly, for the control group, these \nresults were 50 %, 2.57 months and 4.17 months.  \n \n5.43 Study No. YMB -1000 -018 (terminated early, Phase II in Brain met from NSCLC).  \n \nA Phase II, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, multicenter clinical study of \nWhole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT) in combination with nimotuzumab (experimental arm) \ncompared to WBRT in combination with placebo in patients with brain metastasis  from NSCLC \nwas performed in 8 clinical sites in Canada. The study was designed to assess the efficacy of \nnimotuzumab in combination with WBRT. The primary endpoint was to compare the intracranial \ndisease progression over 6 months (calculated using RECIST criteria) between nimotuzumab in \ncombination with WBRT (experimental arm) and placebo in combination with WBRT (control \narm) and to document the safety and tolerability of nimotuzumab in combination with WBRT \nand secondary endpoints were OS, intracranial d isease progression at 2, 4 and 6 months, survival \nrate at 6 months, time to intracranial disease progression, time to neurological progression or \ndeath with evidence of neurological progression and time to overall disease progression. A total \nof 21 patient s were recruited on the study,  and 18 patients were administered the study drug . \nEleven patients administered  i.v. infusion of nimotuzumab at 200 mg dose once a week for 8 . \nRadiotherapy consisted of 30 Gy WBRT in 10 fractions of 3 Gy/day (5 days a week) for 2 weeks . \nSeven patients  were administered placebo once a week for 8 and radiotherapy consisted of 30 Gy \nWBRT in 10 fractions of 3 Gy/day (5 days a week) for 2 weeks. If local control was achieved \nafter 8 doses, nimotuzumab (200 mg) or placebo was continu ed on a weekly regimen until disease \nprogression in the brain, unacceptable toxicity, death or withdrawal of consent, whichever \noccur red first. The study was initiated in September 2009 and terminated in June 2011.  \nFor the safety analysis , 18 patients were considered . Treatment -emergent adverse events were \nexperienced in all patients. The most common adverse events regardless of relationship to the \nstudy drug in all patients were fatigue (61.1 %), headache (55.6 %), alopecia (44.4 %), nausea \n(38.9 %), decreased appeti te (33.3 %), muscular weakness (33.3 %), constipation (27.8 %), \nvomiting (27.8 %), edema peripheral (27.8 %), and dyspnea (27.8 %), and the most common \ntreatment -related adverse events attributed to nimot uzumab arm was pain in extremity (18.2 %). \nSee Appendix B, Table B -43 for a complete listing of related AEs.  \nThere were 12 (66.7 %) subjects reported of having SAEs, 7 (63.6 %) on the nimotuzumab \narm (disease progression (2), fatigue (2), muscular weakness (3)) and 5 (71.4 %) on the placebo \narm (disease progression (2), fatigue (2), muscular weakness (1)). All SA E were considered not \nto be related to the study drug.  \nA total of 7 deaths were reported during the study, 3 (42.9 %) on the placebo arm and 4 (36.4 \n%) on nimotuzumab arm, none of the deaths were  related to the study drug.

The study was \ndesigned to assess the efficacy of nimotuzumab or racotumomab in comparison to a group of \npatients receiving docetaxel.  \nThis study was designed with two strata: patients that progressed to the onco especific \ntreatment and patients that did not progress . Each stratum  consisted of three groups of treatments \nwith nimotuzumab, or racotumomab or docetaxel, randomized as 2:2:1, in favor to the study \ndrugs (nimotuzumab and docetaxel).  The primary endpoint was to compare the OS and as \nsecondary endpoints were assessed safety and tolerability of PFS and objective response. A total \nof 461 patients were recruited on the study after rece iving initial onco especific treatment. \nAccording to the study design, for safety and efficacy analysis, only the group of non-progressing  \npatients was considered. In this group of non -progressing , a total of 238 patients (143 male / 95 \nfemale) were recruited,  and 93 patients were administered nimotuzumab (55 male / 38 female), \n93 patients received racotumomab (51 male / 42 female) and 52 patients received the control \ndocetaxel (37 male / 15 female).  \nNimotuzumab was administered as i.v . infusion at 200 mg dose once a week for 6 weeks and \nthen continue with a maintenance phase administered every 2 weeks until unacceptable toxicity. \nRacotumomab was administered intradermal at 1 mg at 5 doses every two weeks and then \ncontinue with a mainten ance phase administered every 28 days until unacceptable toxicity. The \ncontrol group received docetaxel subcutaneously (75 mg/m2) every three weeks until completing \n6 cycles. Study drugs nimotuzumab and racotumomab were administered beyond progression of \nthe disease. The study was  conducted in 65 clinical sites in Cuba. The study  initiated in February \n2013 and completed February 2017.  \nIn the group of patients treated with nimotuzumab, a total of 1166 AEs were reported, 402 \n(34.5%) of these events related to the study drug. The most frequent adverse events related to the \ndrug were myalgia , fever, headache , nausea and arthralgia . The 99.3% of the AEs were classified \nas grade 1 or 2. There were not deaths related to nimotuzumab treatment. See Appendix B, Table \nB-44 for a complete listing of related AEs. The most frequent AEs reported to be related to \nnimotuzumab treatment were myalgia, feve r, headache , nausea and arthralgia. The 99.3% of the \nnimotuzumab related AEs reported were classified as grad e 1 or 2.   \nThere were 24 subjects (25.8 %) on the nimotuzumab arm reported of having SAEs, and in \nonly one of the patients (1.2%) the SAEs were reported to be related to the drug. In the \nnimotuzumab arm a total of 33 SAEs (2.8%) were reported and only one SAEs (0.1%)  was related \nto the drug. A total of 5 deaths (5.4%) were reported during the study in the nimotuzumab arm. \nNone of the deaths were considered to be related to the study drug, but due to disease progression. \nSee Appendix C, Table C -1 for a complete listing  of possibly related SAEs.  \nIn the intent to treat group, the median OS in patients treated with nimotuzumab was 11.2 \nmonths with a survival rate at 12 months of 47.8%, while the median OS in the docetaxel arm \nwas 8.6 months with a survival rate at 12 months of 31%. In the per protoc ol analysis (patients \nthat received at least 6 doses of nimotuzumab) the median OS for the nimotuzumab arm was 12.4 \nmonths with a survival rate at 12 months of 53.5%, compared to 10.1 months and 34.5% in the \ndocetaxel arm for patients that received at leas t 3 cycles of the drug. The disease control rate in \nthe nimotuzumab arm was 60%, while the progression free survival was 4.6 months for this group \nof patients.  \n \n5.45 Study No. HH -2004/2 (completed, Pancreatic Cancer).  \n \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 71 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         A single -arm, open label, multi -center Phase II trial was performed to evaluate the activity of \nnimotuzumab as 2nd -line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic \ncancer.  The primary endpoint was the remission rate in patients rece iving at least 6 cycles of \nnimotuzumab (200 mg). Secondary endpoints included progression -free survival, safety and \nsymptoms  and pain control. This trial was conducted in 6 investigational sites in Germany, and \nit initiated in November 2004 and completed the enrollment in December 2005.  \nA total of 56 patients (28 males/28 females) with ages ranging from 44 to 81 were recruited \nfor treatment. Due to study -relevant protocol deviations two patients were not eligible for \nefficacy analysis. Most  recruited patients (n=42; 77.8 %) had metastatic pancreatic cancer, \nwhereas locally advanced cancer was seen in 7 patients (13.0 %). Five (5) patients (9.3 %) had \nmetastatic and locally advanced pancreatic cancer.  \nFifty -four (54) patients were evaluable for safety.  A total of 266 adverse events were included \nin this analysis. The most common adverse events ( 15 % of patients) were (all grades): fatigue \n(24 patients, 44.4 %), fever (10 patients, 18.5 %), pain – abdomen not otherwise specified (10 \npatients, 18.5 %) and nausea (9 patients, 16.7 %). Of the 266 reported AEs, 33 were assessed as \nrelated to nimotuzum ab treatment. A listing of related AEs by grade is shown in Appendix B, \nTable B -45. The most common nimotuzu mab-related events were fever (4 events) as well as \nfatigue, nausea and chills (3 events each).  \nForty (40) SAEs occurred in 20 patients (37.04 %) and 5 SAEs in 4 patients were assessed to \nbe related to nimotuzumab. No treatment -related deaths were observed. A listing of SAEs is \nprovided in Appendix C, Table C -1.  \nThe tumor  response status of target and non -target lesions documented for 8 weeks was \ncompared to baseline tumor  status according to RECIST.  Of the 54 patients enrolled in the study, \n35 received at least 6 cycles of nimotuzumab and were therefore evaluable for efficacy. Of these \n35 patients, 6 (17.1 %) patients achieved disease stabilization while the remaining 29 (82.8 %) \npatients had progressive disease (PD).    \nPatients' progression -free survival was defined as the interval from date of first administration \nof study drug to date of progression or death, whichever occurs first, or to last follow -up \ninformation (censored observation). Based on the 47 patients evalu able for progression -free \nsurvival, median PFS was 6.71 weeks (95% CI 6.29 – 7.0 weeks) and the one -year PFS rate was \n10.3 % (95% CI 4.5 – 23.7 %).  \nIn conclusion, since no remission was observed, no significant effect and no activity with \nrespect to its primary objective of remission rate after administration of 6 cycles of nimotuzumab \ncould be demonstrated.  \n \n5.46 Study OSAG 101 -PCS -07 (completed, Pancreatic Cancer).  \n \nThis was a Phase IIb/IIIa, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter clinical \nstudy of gemcitabine and monoclonal antibody nimotuzumab (OSAG 101) versus gemcitabine \nand placebo for the treatment of chemotherapy -naive patients with locally a dvanced unresectable \nor metastatic pancreatic cancer that was performed in 13 clinical sites in Germany, 2 in Türkiye  \nand 1 in Switzerland. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the antitumor activity, \nas assessed by Overall Survival (OS) of th e patients and secondary endpoints were the time -to-\nprogression, the overall response rate, clinical benefit rate and duration of response, the effect of \nnimotuzumab on Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), quality of life (EORTC Score), and the \nsafety profi le of nimotuzumab in combination with gemcitabine. Patients were recruited into 2 \narms, on the treatment arm patients were administered i.v . infusion of nimotuzumab at 400 mg \ndose once a week until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity and gemcitabi ne 1000 mg/m2 \nonce weekly for 3 weeks, followed by a 1 -week rest (d1, 8, 15; q28) and on the control arm \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 72 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         patients were administered i.v . infusion of placebo once a week until progressive disease or \nunacceptable toxicity and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 once weekly for 3 weeks, followed by a 1 -\nweek rest (d1, 8, 15; q28). The study was initiated in September 2007 and completed in \nNovember 2012 (Interim Report January 2014).  \nA total of 192 patients were recruited on the study and 186 patients were administered the \nstudy drug, 93 patients (61 males and 32 female) with a mean age of 64 years, range (31, 82) \nyears were randomized to the treatment arm and 93 patients (55 males and  38 female) with a \nmean age of 63.2 years, range (42, 82) years were randomized to the control arm.  \nIn the safety data set of study OSAG 101 -PCS-07 there were 186 patients who received \ntreatment (93 patients on the gemcitabine plus nimotuzumab arm and 93 patients on the \ngemcitabine plus placebo arm). These patients experienced a total of 1641 adverse eve nts (AEs) \nreported in 180 patients (96.8 %). Out of 1641 AEs, 896 AEs in 90 patients (96.8 %) occurred \non the gemcitabine plus nimotuzumab arm and 745 AEs in 90 patients (96.8 %) occurred on the \ngemcitabine plus placebo arm. The most frequently reported AE s (> 14 patients, 15.1 %) on the \ngemcitabine plus nimotuzumab arm regardless of relationship to the study drug, were nausea (34 \nsubjects, 36.6 %), fatigue (28 subjects, 30.1 %), thrombocytopenia (24 subjects, 25.8 %), pyrexia \n(24 subjects, 25.8 %), diarrhea  (22 subjects, 23.7 %), abdominal pain (21 subjects, 22.6 %), \nleukopenia (20 subjects, 21.5 %), vomiting (19 subjects, 20.4 %), chills (17 subjects, 18.3 %), \nrash (17 subjects, 18.3 %), constipation (16 subjects, 17.2 %) and appetite decreased (15 subject s, \n16.1 %).  \nOf the 896 AEs that occurred on the gemcitabine plus nimotuzumab arm, 378 were not related \nand 519 AEs in 78 patients (83.9 %) were reported to be related to the study drug and of 745 AEs \non the gemcitabine plus placebo arm, 338 were not related and 407 AE s in 67 patients (72.0 %) \nwere reported to be related to gemcitabine. The most common study -drug related AEs (> 14 \npatients, 15.1 %) were nausea (30 subjects, 32.3 %), thrombocytopenia (23 subjects, 24.7 %), \nleukopenia (21 subjects, 22.6 %), fatigue (20 su bjects, 21.5 %), pyrexia (15 subjects, 16.1 %) \nand rash (14 subjects, 15.1 %). See Appendix B, Table B -46 for a listing of all related adverse \nevents.  \nOf the 926 AEs reported to be related in the study, there were 519 AEs on the gemcitabine \nplus nimotuzumab arm, of them 324 AEs in 69 patients (74.2 %) were Grade 1, 154 AEs in 51 \npatients (54.8 %) were Grade 2 and 41 AEs in 24 patients (25.8 %) were Grade  3 or 4 and 407 \nAEs on the gemcitabine plus placebo arm, of them 238 AEs in 56 patients (60.2 %) were Grade \n1, 115 AEs in 44 patients (47.3 %) were Grade 2 and 54 AEs in 25 patients (26.9 %) were Grade \n3 or 4. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 trea tment -related adverse events in patients \ntreated with gemcitabine plus nimotuzumab were leukopenia (4.3 %), neutropenia (4.3 %), \nnausea (3.2 %), vomiting (3.2 %), thrombocytopenia (2.2 %), rash (2.2 %) and general physical \ndeterioration (2.2 %).  \nSerious adverse events were reported in 119 (64.0 %) patients, 57 (61.3 %) patients on the \ngemcitabine plus nimotuzumab arm and 62 (66.7 %) patients on gemcitabine plus placebo arm. \nOn these 119 patients, a total of 234 SAEs were reported. Of them 117 SAEs  on the gemcitabine \nplus nimotuzumab arm, were reported in 57 patients (61.3 %) and 117 SAEs on the gemcitabine \nplus placebo arm, were reported in 62 patients (66.7 %). Of the 117 SAEs, reported on the \ngemcitabine plus nimotuzumab arm, 16 SAEs in 8 patient s (8.6 %) were reported to be related \nto the study drug. Most common SAEs reported to be related to study drug gemcitabine plus \nnimotuzumab were nausea (2 subjects, 2.2 %), vomiting (2 subjects, 2.2 %), and \nthrombocytopenia (2 subjects, 2.2 %) ( See Appendix C, Table C -1 for a complete listing of \npossibly related SAEs) and of 117 SAEs, reported on the gemcitabine plus placebo arm, 15 SAEs \nin 12 patients (12.9 %) were reported to be related to gemcitabine. The most common SAE \nreported to be related to gemcita bine was the hemolytic uremic  syndrome (2 subjects, 2.2 %). No \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 73 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         notable difference was found in the incidence of serious adverse events between the treatment \narms.  \nThere were 176 patients (94.5 %) who died during  the study. Fifty -four (54) death were \nreported as SAEs (22 deaths on the gemcitabine plus nimotuzumab arm and 32 deaths on the \ngemcitabine plus placebo arm). In no case, did the investigator associate a causal relationship \nbetween the death of a patient a nd the application of the study drug.  \n \n5.47 Study No. IIC RD EC -0166 (completed, Phase I V in pancreatic cancer ). \nThis was a Phase IV multicenter, open, uncontrolled, non -randomized, clinical trial to evaluate \nthe safety and efficacy of CIMAher® (nimotuzumab) in the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or non -resectable metastatic pancreatic cancer, in either r ecurrent or newly diagnosed \npatients.  \nSeventy -one (71) patients treated with nimotuzumab,  and chemotherapy (CT) were included. \nNimotuzumab 400 mg was administered intravenously (IV) and on an outpatient basis, once a \nweek until discontinuation for any of the causes foreseen in the protocol. The CT administered \nduring the first year was gemcita bine 1000 mg/m2 (30 min intravenous infusion) on days 1, 8, \n15, followed by a 1 -week rest and repeat the previous regimen until disease progression. The \nprotocol was then modified, and CT was selected at t he decision of the investigator, according to \nthe NCCN oncology guideline version 3.2017, the availability of the institution and the functional \ncapacity of the patient.  \nThe study foresaw a treatment period of 2 years, to evaluate patients from the clinical point of \nview, and complementary hematological and biochemical examinations were performed prior to \ninclusion and before starting each CT cycle. Every two CT cycles or when disease progression \nwas suspected; patients were evaluated through imaging tests (Rx, US and CT). If the patient had \neither an objective response or stable disease, CT continued. If the patient progressed, the CT \nscheme was changed and the treatment c ontinued in combination with nimotuzumab until a new \nprogression of the disease. Serious adverse events (AE) with a highly probable, probable and \npossible causality relationship with nimotuzumab were considered as the primary endpoint, and \nthe intensity an d causality of the AE, 2 -year overall survival, progression free survival and \ndisease control rate (complete, partial or stability of the disease) were considered as secondary \nendpoints. The study initiated in May 2017 and completed in March 2020.  \nThe safety profile analysis  showed that nimotuzumab  is a safe medication. Most related EAs \nwere light and moderate and evolved towards recovery or improvement. No patient died because \nof an adverse event associated with the use of the Nimotuzumab.  The most frequent EAs were \nnausea (10%), anemia (8%), abdominal pain (8%), decay (5%) and vomiting (5%). See \nAppendix B, Table B -47 for a listing of all related adverse events.  \nThe related EA frequency was 8.1%, and the proportion of nimotuzumab related SAE (very \nlikely, likely or possible) was 1.2%.  Twenty -three  percent of the patients presented events \nattributable to the administration of nimotuzumab. The proportion of patients with at least one \nrelated SAE event was 1.5%, so the hypothesis proposed in the study that the incidence of these \nevents was less than 3 5% was fulfilled  (See Appendix C, Table C -1 for a complete listing of \npossibly related SAEs).   \nIn the overall survival analysis on the ITT population, a median overall survival SV of 9.0 \nmonths (IC95%, 8.36 -15.11) was observed, and 1 -year and 2 -year survival rates of 38.8 and 7.6 \nmonths, respectively. In the subgroup of patients with locally advance d disease, the median \noverall survival was 16.36 months (IC95%, 14.35 -18.38) with 1 -year and 2 -year survival rates \nof 72.2 and 29.2 months, respectively. In patients with metastatic disease, the median overall \nsurvival was 6.23 months (IC95%, 4.32 -8.13) wi th 1-year and 2 -year survival rates of 18.1 and \n3.0 months, respectively. In this scenario, ITT patients with ECOG greater than or equal to 2, are \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 74 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         likely to die 62.3 times greater than patients with ECOG equal to zero . Additionally, t hose of \nstage III of the disease, had a 49.0 times greater probability of dying  than those of stage I or II; \nand those of acinar cell histology, a probability 355.8 times greater than those of a histological \ntype of ductal adenocarcinoma. Patients with metastatic disease at the time of inclusion and \nECOG greater than or equal to 2, ar e likely to die 3.9 times greater than patients with ECOG \nequal to zero.  \nIn the analysis of overall survival in the per protocol (PP) scenario, a median overall survival \nof 11.7 months (IC95%, 8.36 -15.11), and 1 -year and 2 -year survival rates of 38.8 and 7.6, \nrespectively were  achieved. In patients with locally advanced disease, a median survival of 17.36 \nmonths (IC95% 15.56 -19.17) was reached, and the 1 -year and 2 -year survival rates were 78.7 \nand 31.9 months, respectively. In patients with metastatic disease, a median surviva l of 8.4 \nmonths (IC95%, 6.31 -110.42), and 1 -year and  2-year survival rates of 23.0 and 4.6 months , \nrespectively were achieved. Although with a very small risk difference, patients with tumors \nlocated in the head and tail of the pancreas, had a probability of death 0.017 and 0.009 times, \nrespectively higher than patients with tumors located on the head of the pancreas. On the other  \nhand, patients of acinar  cell histology, have a 970 times greater probability of death from \npancreatic cancer than those of a ductal adenocarcinoma. In patients with metastatic disease, no \nvariable was prognostic in the multivariate analysis.  \nIn the ITT population, a PFS of 8.03 ± 0.99 months (6.08 -9.90) was obtained. In patients with \nlocally advanced disease was obtained a median PFS of 9.6 -month (IC95%, 4.91 -14.20), and a \n1-year PFS rate of 39%, whereas no patient reached a 2 -year PFS. In pat ients with metastatic \ndisease, a median of 7.6 -month PFS (IC95%, 6.08 -9.90) was achieved, a 1 -year and 2 -year PFS \nrates  of 20.5 and 5.1, respectively. Patients with locally advanced disease and tumor located in \nthe body of the pancreas had a risk of death by disease progression 324 times greater than those \nwho have tumors located at the head of the pancreas.  \nThe clinical response showed a complete remission in 3.1% and a partial remission in 15.4% \nof the patients, which accounts for  an objective response in 18.5% of the patients. Disease  control  \nwas achieved in 43.1 % of the patients of the study. In patients with locally advanced disease, the \nclinical response was evaluated in 18 patients; 8.7% showed complete remission (2 patients) and \n30.4% partial remission (7 patients), which means an objective response of 39.1%. The control \ndisease was achieve d in 60.9% of  the patients of this stratum.  In patients with metastatic disease, \nthe clinical response was evaluated in 20 patients. There was no complete remission, and 15.0% \nshowed objective response (partial remission), achieving a control disease in 33.3% of patients \nof this stratum.  \nThree out of the four patients with recurrent disease upon inclusion, had a partial response and \none stable disease, achieving an objective response in 75% of the patients, and control  disease in \nall these patients. In the PP population, a 4.3 % complete remission and 21.7 % partial remission  \nwere observed , which contributed to an objective response of 26.1%. Disease control was \nachieved in 60.9% of the study patients.  In patients with locally advanced disease, was obtained \na 10.0% of complete remission (2 pa tients) and 35.0% of partial remission (7 patients), which \ncontributed to an objective response of 45.0%. Disease control was achieved in 70% of the \npatients in this stratum.  In patients with metastatic disease there was no complete remission, and \nthe objective response was 11.5% (3 patients with partial remission), achieving a disease control \nin 53.8% of these patients.  \nIn this study , nimotuzumab was safe and well -tolerated. The proportion of patients with \nrelated SAE (very likely, probable, or possible) attributable to the use of nimotuzumab was very \nlow, and most adverse reactions were  mild and reversible. No patients died due to the \nadministration of nimotuzumab.  \n \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 75 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         5.48 Study No. BPL -Nim-PC-1 (completed, Phase III in pancreatic cancer).  \nThis was a phase III, multicenter, controlled, randomized, double -blind clinical study of \ngemcitabine in combination with nimotuzumab (experimental arm) compared to gemcitabine \nplus placebo (control arm) in patients with K -Ras wild -type locally advanced or  metastatic \npancreatic cancer. The primary endpoint was to assess the OS of the patients treated with \nnimotuzumab in combination with gemcitabine compared to placebo and gemcitabine alone. The \nsecondary endpoints were to determine time to disease progressi on (TTP), progression -free \nsurvival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), clinical benefit \nresponse (CBR) and safety (according to NCI CTCAE v4.03).  \nThe total number of patients originally planned to be enrolled was 276, and they were \nrandomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1, that is, the experimental group and the control group were \ndivided into 138 cases each. Because K -Ras wild -type pancreatic cancer is rare and difficult to \nenroll, and the original sample size was estimated based on the data of the entire pancreatic cancer \npopulation, a new sample size was calculated, based on the survival data of K -Ras wild -type \npancreatic cancer in the PCS07 study (Ger many). According to the new criteria, it was estimated \nthat 79 subjects and 64 events can meet the statistically sufficient sample size. Therefore, the \nfinal statistical analysis was performed on the 92 enrolled cases.  \nNimotuzumab injection was administered at a dose of 400 mg, intravenous infusion, with an \ninfusion time of 60 minutes. Nimotuzumab treatment was administered once a week until disease \nprogression or unacceptable toxicity, or subject requests to withdraw fr om the trial.  Gemcitabine \nwas administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2, intravenous infusion for no less than 30 minutes, \ncontinuous use for 3 weeks, 1 -week rest (d1, 8, 15; q28 d), every 4 weeks as a cycle, until disease \nprogression or intolerable toxicity response, or subject requests to withdraw from the trial. For \nthe fi rst treatment, Nimotuzumab/placebo and gemcitabine were administered on the same day, \nNimotuzumab/placebo was infused first, and gemcitabine was administered 1 hour after the end \nof Nimotuzumab/placebo infusion. Thereafter, nimotuzumab/placebo was treated on the same \nday as gemcitabine, in the same order as before.  \nThe study was  conducted in 25 investigation centers in China and it initiated in April 2015 \nand completed in November 2021.  \nFor efficacy analysis, a total of 82 subjects were included in the full analysis set (FAS), \nincluding 41 in the experimental group and 41 in the control group. Fifty -nine cases were \nincluded in the per -protocol set (PPS), including 28 cases in the experime ntal group and 31 cases \nin the control group. Patients who did not complete the treatment for ≥6 weeks were also included \nin the PPS set for sensitivity analysis, with 37 cases in the experimental group and 36 cases in \nthe control group. Ninety cases were included in the safety analysis set (SS set), including 45 \ncases in the experimental group and 45 cases in the control group.  \nThere were 41 cases in the experimental group, the number of events was 36 cases (87.8%), \nand the mOS was 10.9 months . In the control group , there were  41 cases, the n umber of events \nwas 40 cases (97.6%), and the mOS was 8.5 months. Compared with the control group, the mOS \nin the nimotuzumab arm was prolonged by 2.4 months, with statistical  clinical significance.  \nThe overall survival rate of the experimental group compared to  the control group at different \ntimes (OS Rate) was as follows: the 6 -month OS rate (65.9% vs. 63.4%), 1 -year OS rate (43.6% \nvs. 26.8%), 1.5 -year OS rate (33.4% vs. 17.1%), 2 -year OS rate (20.0% vs. 14.2%), and 3 -year \nOS rate (14.3% vs. 2.8%). The restrict ed mean survival time (RMST) method was used to \ncalculate the survival between groups. In the FAS population, adjusted by various stratified \nrandom factors, a significant benefit in the nimotuz umab arm was observed (HR=0.50, 95% CI \n0.07-0.93, P=0.024). Multiple subgroup analyses showed a significant survival benefit with the \naddition of nimotuzumab, in patients with no prior management of biliary obstruction (11.9 vs. \n8.4 months), HR=0.54), no h istory of surgery (15.8 vs. 6.0 months), HR=0.40) and duration of \nthe disease <1 year (9.7 vs. 8.1 months, HR=0.60).  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 76 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         In the PPS analysis, a total of 59 cases were evaluated, 28 cases in the experimental group, \nand 24 cases in the control group. The mOS in the experimental arm was 11.5 months’ vs 8.5 \nmonths in the control group, with a clear benefit in favor of the nimotu zumab arm. The results \nof OS rate analysis of PPS population at different times showed a 6 -month OS rate (71.4% vs. \n67.7%), 1 -year OS rate (45.9% vs. 29.0%), 1.5 -year OS rate (30.6%) vs. 19.4%), 2 -year OS rate \n(23.0% vs. 15.5%), and 3 -year OS rate (19.1% v s. 3.9%) were all improved, with the addition of \nnimotuzumab to the experimental arm. The Cox regression risk model was used to calculate the \nhazard ratio (HR) of death between the experimental group and the control group in the PPS \npopulation, HR=0.61, 95 % CI was 0.35 -1.05, suggesting that the experimental group had a 39% \nlower risk of death.  \nFor the PFS analysis in the FAS, among 41 patients in the experimental group and 41 patients \nin the control group, a longer mPFS of 4.2 vs 3.6 months was observed in favor of the \nexperimental group. The FAS PFS rate analysis showed a 6 -month PFS Rate (40.2 % vs.22.5%), \n1-year PFS rate (15.5% vs. 6.4%), and 1.5 -year PFS Rate (15.5% vs. 3.2%) significant better for \nthe nimotuzumab arm.  \nFor the median time to progression in the FAS analysis, patients in the experimental arm \nshowed a clinically significant improvement (4.7 vs 3.7 months) compared to the control group.  \nFor the objective response rate in the FAST analysis, no significant differences were observed \n(7.3% in the experimental arm vs 9.8% in the control arm; P>0.05).  \nSimilarly, no significant differences were observed between the experimental arm and the \ncontrol arm regarding disease control rate (68.3% vs 63.4%, P>0.05), nor in the clinical benefit \nresponse (39.3% vs 32.3%, P>0.05).  \nIn summary, nimotuzumab combined with gemcitabine had a significant effect in the \ntreatment of K -Ras wild -type locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The median \noverall survival was prolonged by 2.4 months , and the 1 -year survival rate increased  to 43.6%. \nAdditionally, patients treated with nimotuzumab significantly reduced the risk of death (3 9%), \nwhile increased the progression -free survival and time to disease progression. The disease control \nrates tended to increase, delaying disease progress ion, despite no significant differences being  \nobserved.  \nFor safety analysis, a total of 90 patients were included, 45 in the experimental arm and 45 in \nthe control arm. Treatment -related adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 44 patients (97.8%) in \nthe experimental arm and 44 patients (97.8%) in the control arm, wi th no statistical difference \nbetween the two groups. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred in 31 patients (68.9%) in the \nexperimental arm and 29 patients (64.4%) in the control arm. Serious adverse events (SAEs) \noccurred in 15 (33.3%) patients in the expe rimental arm and 8 (17.8%) in the control arm. Serious \nadverse drug-related reactions (SADRs) occurred in only 1 patient (2.2%) in the experimental \narm compared with 2 patients (4.4%) in the control arm. Among them, drug dose reduction or \nsuspension of TEAE resulted in 12 cases (26.7%) in the experimental arm and 11 cases (24.4%) \nin the control arm. Regarding  drug reduction or suspension of ADR, there were 4 cases (8.9%) \nin the experimental arm and 6 cases (13.3%) in the control arm. TEAE resulted in drug \ndiscontinuation, 6 cases (13.3%) in the experimental arm and 4 cases (8.9%) in the control arm. \nADR resulted in drug discontinuation, 2 cases (4.4%) in the experimental arm and 2 cases (4.4%) \nin the control arm. TEAE resulted in death, 8 cases (17.8%) in th e experimental arm and 5 cases \n(11.1%) in the control arm. There were 0 cases of ADR in the experimental arm and 1 case in \nthe control arm (2.2%). Resulted in withdrawal from TEAE, 6 cases (13.3%) in the experimental \narm and 3 cases (6.7%) in the control a rm. Resulted in withdrawal from ADR, 2 cases (4.4%) in \nthe experimental arm and 1 case (2.2%) in the arm group, with no significant differences between \nthe groups.  \nThe most common reported AEs in the experimental arm were decreased white blood cell \ncount (75.6 %), decreased neutrophil count (71.1 %), decreased platelet count (48.9 %), anemia \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 77 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         (42.2 %), elevated alanine aminotransferase (40.0 %), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase \n(40.0 %). The most common reported AEs in the control arm were decreased neutrophil count \n(60.0 %), decreased white blood cell count (57.8 %), anemia (53.3 %), el evated alanine \naminotransferase (48.9 %), decreased platelet count (46.7 %), and elevated aspartate \naminotransferase (44.4 %). No significant differences were reported between the experimental \narm and the control arm. See Appendix B, Table B -48 for a compl ete listing of related AEs.   \nA total of 23 serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred, 15 in the experimental group and 8 in \nthe control group. According to the classification of system organs, the most common SAEs were \n7 (15.6 %) cases in the experimental group and 4 (8.9 %) cases in the  control group due to \nsystemic diseases and various reactions at the site of administration; and 6 (13.3 %) cases in the \nexperimental group and 4 (8.9 %) cases in the control group due to disease progression. See \nAppendix C, Table C -1 for a complete listin g of possibly related SAEs.  \n \n \n5.49 Study No. IIC RD EC -074 (completed, Phase II in prostate cancer).  \nThis was a Phase II, multicenter, controlled, randomized, open -label trial of mitoxantrone -\nprednisone in combination with nimotuzumab (experimental arm) compared to mitoxantrone -\nprednisone (control arm) in hormone -refractory prostate cancer patients. The s tudy was designed \nto evaluate the overall survival of the patients with hormone -refractory prostate adenocarcinoma \nwhen treated with nimotuzumab in combination with mitoxantrone -prednisone. The primary \nendpoint was to assess the OS of the patients treated with nimotuzumab in combination with \nmitoxantrone -prednisone compared to mitoxantrone -prednisone alone. The secondary endpoints \nwere to determine time -to-progression, anti -tumor response, QoL, pain reduction, \nimmunogenicity, safety profile and tolerability  of the administration of nimotuzumab in \ncombination with mitoxantrone -prednisone versus mitoxantrone -prednisone alone.  \nA total of 70 patients were recruited on the study and 70 patients were administered the study \ndrug, 35 patients were administered on different days to chemotherapy i.v . infusion of \nnimotuzumab at 200 mg dose every 2 weeks during chemotherapy and chemotherapy consisted \non mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 i.v. once every 3 weeks for 10 cycles and prednisone 10 mg oral every \nday during chemotherapy and 35 patients were administered chemotherapy consistent on \nmitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 i.v. once every 3 weeks for 10 cycles and prednisone 10 mg oral every \nday during chemotherapy. This study was conducted in 8 investigation sites in Cuba. The study \nwas initiated in July 2005 and completed in February 2011.  \nOn the intent to treat analysis the median OS was 12.57 months (95 % CI, 8.55 to 16.58) for \nthe nimotuzumab plus chemotherapy and 10.93 months (95 % CI, 6.30 to 15.57) for the \nchemotherapy mitoxantrone plus prednisone. No statistically significant differen ces between the \ntreatment arms were  found (p = 0.9665). The median time to progression for the treatment arm \n(31 patients) was 8.63 months (95 % CI, 5.16 to 12.11) and for the control arm (32 patients) was \n7.97 months (95 % CI, 7.13 to 8.80). No statistica lly significant differences between the treatment \narms were  found (p=0.4670).  \nFor the safety analysis 64 patients were considered , 32 on the treatment and 32 on the control \narm. The most common adverse events regardless of relationship to the study drug in all patients \nwere bone pain (25 %), anemia (21.9 %), edema lower limbs (15.6 %), asthenia (14.1 %) and \nanorexia (12.5 %) and the  most common treatment -related adverse  events attributed to \nnimotuzumab arm were bone pain (15.6 %), anemia, asthenia, chills and weight loss (9.4%) each. \nSee Appendix B, Table B -49 for a complete listing of related AEs.  \nThere were 5 (15.6 %) subjects reported  having six (6) SAEs after the administration of \nnimotuzumab (renal failure (1), edema lower limbs (1), asthenia (1), bone pain (2) and \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 78 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         hemoglobin decreased (1)). From them only 2 SAE were  related with the administration of \nnimotuzumab, asthenia  (1) and hemoglobin decreased (1) on the same subject.  \nA total of 61 deaths were reported during the study, 30 (93.8 %) on the control arm and 31 \n(96.9 %) on nimotuzumab arm. None of the deaths were  related to the administration of \nnimotuzumab. See Appendix C, Table C -1 for a complete listing of possibly related SAEs.  \n \n5.50 Study No. IIC RD EC -035 (completed, Epithelial Tumor s). \n \nThis was a Phase I, open -label clinical trial of nimotuzumab conducted in 12 patients with \nhistologically confirmed  advanced stage epithelial tumor s who were not suitable for any further \ntherapy with curative intention and had not received cancer treatment in at least 4 weeks. Patients \nwere divided into 4 cohorts (3 patients/cohort), and each received a single intravenous infusion \nof 50, 100, 200, or  400 mg of nimotuzumab over a period of 30 minutes. Three milligrams of \neach dose were radiolabeled with 99mT c-nimotuzumab to investigate pharmacokinetic and \nbiodistribution parameters.  This study was conducted in 3 investigation sites in Cuba , and it \ninitiated in August 1998 and completed in October 1999.   \nTwelve patients [11 females and 1 male, mean age 59 years (range 35 to 74)] were treated \nwith nimotuzumab.  \nFollowing administration of the single dose of nimotuzumab monotherapy,  7 of the 12 \npatients enrolled in this study reported adverse events that included tremor (5 patients), fever (2 \npatients), nausea (1 patient), vomit (2 patients), dry mouth (1 patient ), hot flashes (1 patient), \nredness (1 patient), weakness of the lower limbs (1 patient), chest pain (1 patient), peribuccal \ncyanosis (1 patient), tachycardia (1 patient), blood pressure increase (1 patient), frontal headache  \n(1 patient) and lower limb pai n (1 patient). In all cases the adverse events were mild to moderate \naccording to the WHO classification and were completely reversible. All the adverse events in \nthis study were assessed as being related to nimotuzumab. No serious adverse events (SAE) were \nreported,  and no patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events. One patient died during \nfollow -up due to disease progression. A listing of related AEs is provided in Appendix B , Table \nB-50.  \nThere was no efficacy parameters investigated in this study.  \n \n5.51 Study No. YMB -1000 -007 (completed, Solid Tumor s). \n \nThis was a Phase I, open -label, dose -escalation trial in patients with advanced incurable solid \ntumor s and was sponsored by Princess Margaret Hospital  in Canada . One of the objectives of \nthis Phase I clinical trial was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the \nrecommended Phase II dose of nimotuzumab administered weekly for 6 weeks then every 2 \nweeks in patients with advanced solid malignancies. Other  objectives were to determine the \nsafety, tolerability, toxicity profile, and dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) of nimotuzumab when \ngiven according to this schedule to patients with advanced cancer, to assess the \npharmacodynamic activity of nimotuzumab, and to obtain preliminarily evidence of the anti -\ntumor  activity of nimotuzumab in patients with measurable disease. Patients were enrolled into \n4 cohorts of 3 to 6 patients each and were administered 100, 200, 400 or 800 mg of nimotuzumab \nonce weekly by intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes until e vidence of dose -limiting \ntoxicity or disease progression. This study was initiated in May 2005 and completed in November \n2008.  \nSeventeen (17) patients, 11 males and 6 females (mean age 63 years range 52 to 74) were \nenrolled into the study. Primary tumor  types consisted primarily of colorectal tumor s (n=13) as \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 79 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         well as mesothelioma (n=2), pancreatic (n=1) and endometrial (n=1). One patient experienced \ndisease progression prior to receiving the first dose of nimotuzumab and was therefore not \nevaluable for safety or efficacy. An additional 4 patients did not complete c ycle 1 and were \ntherefore not eligible for efficacy assessment.  \nSixteen (16) patients reported at least 1 adverse event during the study. There was one \noccurrence of a grade 4 adverse event: hyponatremia at the 800 mg dose level. Of the 16 patients \nreporting adverse events, 14 reported at least 1 adverse event that was  deemed related to \nnimotuzumab. These related adverse events were primarily grade 1 or 2 in severity, although \nthere were 2 grade 3 events (fatigue and decreased hemoglobin) observed at the 100 mg dose \nlevel that was considered a dose -limiting toxicity, as  defined in the protocol. Related adverse \nevents are summarized in Appendix B, Table B -51. \nSix (6) SAEs were reported in five patients, and none of the cases were thought to be related \nto nimotuzumab. Following admission for an SAE of cancer pain, 1 patient died while in hospital \ndue to malignancy.  \nThe efficacy of nimotuzumab was evaluated based on best overall responses to treatment.  Of \nthe 12 patients evaluable for efficacy, stable disease was reported as the best response in eight \npatients, and there was one case of partial response in a patient with mesothelioma. The \nremaining 3 patients experienced disease progression.  \nThe pharmacodynamic activity of nimotuzumab was assessed by examining the correlation \nbetween phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) in tumor  tissue, skin and liver and a good outcome, \ndefined as objective response or stable disease lasting at least four cycles. The results of the study \ndemonstrate that there was no statistically significant association between a good outcome and \npEGFR staining  before treatment or the difference in pEGFR staining during treatment. In most \ncases, odds ratios were greater than 1.00, sug gesting that higher levels of pEGFR staining before \ntreatment or the difference in pEGFR staining during treatment predicted a good outcome, \nalthough in none of the cases  such association reach ed statistical significance, possibly because \nof the small sample size. However, a true lack of association is also possible.  \nIn summary, the results of this Phase I study suggest that nimotuzumab was well tolerated \nwhen used in this schedule. Dose escalation up to 800 mg was feasible, with no increase in the \nincidence of adverse events. The MTD has not been reached and doses up to 800 mg can be used.  \n \n5.52 Study No. DE766 -A-J101 (completed, solid tumor s). \n \nThis was an open -label Phase I dose escalation study designed to assess the safety and \npharmacokinetics of nimotuzumab in patients with solid tumor s. Secondary objectives included \nimmunogenicity, preliminary tumor  response and preliminary pharmacodynamic evaluation. \nPatients were treated with 100 mg, 200 mg or 400 mg nimotuzumab once a week until disease \nprogression. The initial dose level was 100 mg, and the dose was escalated to 200 and 400 mg, \nin that order, aft er confirming the presence or absence of do se limiting toxicity (DLT). This study \nwas conducted in two investigational sites in Japan , and it initiated in May 2007 and completed \nin August 2008.  \nThirteen (13) patients were enrolled in the study: 5 at the 100 mg dose level, 4 at the 200 mg \ndose level and 4 at the 400 mg dose level. One patient assigned to the 100 mg dose level withdrew \nfrom the study prior to study drug administration and was there fore excluded from the safety \nanalysis. An additional patient was excluded from the efficacy analysis because he was later \nfound to meet the exclusion criteria of the protocol. The 12 patients in the safety population \ncomprised 5 males and 7 females with a  mean age of 57.2 years while the efficacy population \nconsisted of 11 patients (4 males/7 females) with a similar mean age of 57.9 years.   \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 80 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         All patients (N=12) in the safety analysis population experienced at least 1 adverse event \nduring all courses of study drug administration and, in most patients [3 (75.0 %), 4 (100.0 %) \nand 4 (100.0 %) in the 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg groups, respectively]  treatment -related \nadverse events. Adverse events that were observed relatively frequently during all courses were \nconstipation and rash in 6 (50.0 %) patients each, diarrhea and blood potassium increased in 5 \n(41.7 %) patients each, and nausea, fatigue, p yrexia, and blood glucose increased in 4 (33.3 %) \npatients each. No Grade 4 or 5 adverse event was observed in any course. Grade 3 adverse events \nwere hypoxia in 1 patient receiving 100 mg and diarrhea in 1 patient receiving 200 mg of the \nstudy drug. The m ost common treatment -related adverse event (>30.0 % of patients) was rash, \nwhich was observed in 6 (50.0 %) patients. By dose level, rash was observed in 2 (50.0 %) \npatients each at 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg . Grade 3 or higher adverse drug reactions were n ot \nobserved in any of the courses and no DLTs were observed. All related AEs are provided in \nAppendix B , Table B -52. No patient withdrew from the study due to an adverse event.  \nTwo (2) (50.0 %) patients in the 100 mg group and 1 (25.0 %) patient in the 400 mg group \nexperienced SAEs during the treatment period but they were not regarded as adverse drug \nreactions. No deaths occurred during the study.  \nCR and PR were not observed in any of the 11 patients belonging to the efficacy analysis set. \nTumor  response was classified as SD in 8 (72.7 %) patients and PD in 3 (27.3 %) patients. By \ndose level, SD was observed in 3 (100 %) patients, 3 (75 %) patients, and 2 (50 %) patients at \n100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg, respectively. PD was not observed at 100 mg b ut was observed in \n1 (25 %) patient and 2 (50 %) patients at 200 and 400 mg, respectively.  \n \n5.53 Human Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution  \n \nThis summary provides a review of available pharmacokinetic and biodistribution results \nobserved in seven clinical studies. The studies were conducted in breast cancer (IIC RC EC -070), \ngastric tumor s (DE766 -A-J201) and (DE766 -A-J302), pediatric  glioma (BN -001 PED -04), \nSCCHN (IIC RD EC -046), and solid tumors (IIC RD EC -035) and (DE766 -A-J101).  \n5.53.1  Study No. IIC RD EC -070 (Breast)  \n \nPharmacokinetic analysis was conducted on samples  of patients from each treatment group. \nThree patients were enrolled on each of the following dosage levels: 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg. \nSerum samples were collected on weeks 1 and 10th before i.v . administration and on 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 \nand 7 days following end of i.v . infusion and before administration on the 7th day and on every \nweek before administration of nimotuzumab until week 9th. Additional samples were collected \nbefore 10th administration and after at 1, 6, 14, 20 and 26 days after end of 10th i.v. infusion. Serum \nconcentration of nimotuzumab was determined by receptor -binding ELISA using the external cell \ndomain (ECD -Her1) of EGFR coated to the plates.  \nPharmacokinetic parameters result of nimotuzumab are detailed in Table 4 and Table 5 . After \nfirst administration AUC 0-∞ values decreased from 50 mg to 200 mg with increased of the dose \nfrom 15601.65 µg. h /mL to 7879.41 µg. h /mL and then increased to the highest value 71405.05 \nµg. h /mL at the dose of 400 mg .

Pharmacokinetic parameters of irinotecan \nand SN -38, an active metabolite of irinotecan, in combination with ni motuzumab were \nconsistent with that of irinotecan alone.  \n \n \nTable 7: Study No. DE766 -A-J302 Nimotuzumab Pharmacokinetic Parameters (All \ncountries)  \nPharmacokinetic Parameter \n(unit)  Nimotuzumab + irinotecan  \nN = 6  \nMean (SD)  \nCmax (μg/mL)  162.2 (28.95)  \ntmax (h) 3.417a (0.52, 8.00)b \nλz (h-1) 0.01156 (0.002958)  \nAUC 0-168h (μg·h/mL)  9775 (1983)  \nAUC 0-inf (μg·h/mL)  11810 (3054)  \nt1/2 (h) 64.27 (18.90)  \nCL t (mL/h)  36.08 (9.679)  \nMRT (h)  90.07 (29.89)  \nVd ss (L) 3.108 (0.8643)  \nN, number of patients  \na: Median  \nb: minimum, maximum  \n \n5.53.4  Study No. BN -001 PED -04 (Pediatric Glioma)  \nA subset of patients (15) had serum samples taken for the determination of nimotuzumab \npharmacokinetics. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results were: AUC was 10.1 ± 9.5 mg/ml x h. C max \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 83 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         was 89 ± 46 μm/mL, T 1/2 was 79.4 ± 57.5 h and the volume of distribution was 2.3 ± 1.4 L. Total \nclearance was determined to be 29.4 ± 25.5 mL/h.  \nThese preliminary results demonstrated that AUC and the terminal T 1/2 increased with dose, \nwhile increasing serum concentrations of the nimotuzumab were associated with a decrease in the \nclearance between doses.  \n \n5.53.5  Study No. IIC RD EC -046 (SCCHN)  \n \nPharmacokinetic analyses were conducted on samples from 7 of the 10 patients enrolled.  \nResults showed that at the 200 mg dose, the half-life (T½) ranged between 2.50 and 3.68 days for \nan average value of 3.09 ± 0.83 days. At the 400 mg dose, T ½ ranged between 1.38 and 4.16 days, \nwith an average value of 2.61 ± 1.00 days. These values could be an underestimation since patients \nwere only sampled for 6 days , and accurate determination of terminal half -life requires a longer \nperiod of sampling. Steady state tr ough concentrations were approximately 34.6 µg/mL and 81.9 \nµg/mL for the 200 and 400 mg dose levels, respectively. Steady -state concentrations ranged from \n19.20 to 75.61 µg/mL and 39.25 to 131.10 µg/mL for the 200 and 400 mg doses, respectively.   \n \n5.53.6  Study No. IIC RD EC -035 (Epithelial Tumor s) \n \nBlood samples were collected  from 10 patients at intervals ranging from 5 minutes to 28 days \nfollowing antibody administration.  The concentration of nimotuzumab was measured over time, \nusing a validated ELISA method.  The results suggest that nimotuzumab shows non -linear \npharmacokinetics between the 50 and 200 mg dosages.  The observed increases in the distribution \nvolume and half -life time and decreasing values of plasma clearance as the dose increased from \n50 mg to 200 mg are characteristics of non -linear pharmacokinetics.  \nWhole body images were obtained in 10 minutes, 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours post -injection. Qualitative \nanalysis of the whole -body images showed significant nimotuzumab uptake in the liver, and mild \nto moderate uptake in heart, kidney, spleen and bladder.  In 5 of 12 patients, including 2 patients  \nfrom each of the 50 and 200 mg dose groups, and 1 patient from the 400 mg group, radioactivity \nwas detected in the primary or metastasized tumor s: ovarian carcinoma (3 patients), cerebral \nmetastatic lesions (1 patient) an d renal carcinoma (1 patient).  \n \n5.53.7  Study No. DE766 -A-J101 (Solid Tumor s) \n \nPharmacokinetic analysis was conducted on samples from 11 of the 12 patients enrolled in the \nstudy. During the first 2 courses of treatment, samples were collected prior to administration and \n5 minutes post -administration (Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 50) . Additional samples were collected \nat 1, 3, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours following the first dose.  \nThe results are detailed in Table 8 . The serum nimotuzumab concentration after the first \ntreatment on Course 1 reached maximum upon the completion of treatment (5 minutes after the \ninfusion) at all doses and  decreased moderately. The mean t 1/2 was 34.3, 47.5, and 75.8 h at a dose \nof 100, 200, and 400 mg, respectively.  \nCmax and AUC 0−inf increased dose -dependently but  showed over -proportionality. CL t decreased \ndose-dependently, and the extent of decrease in CL t at 200 to 400 mg was smaller than that at 100 \nto 200 mg. After the second treatment on Course 1, the mean serum nimotuzumab concentration \nincreased moderately to third treatments and  thereafter remained almost constant.  \n \nTable 8: Study No. DE -766-A-J101 Pharmacokinetic Parameters (first administration)  \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 84 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         Pharmacokinetic Parameter \n(unit)  Dose Levels , Mean (SD)  \n100 mg  \nN = 3  200 mg  \nN = 4 400 mg  \nN = 4 \nCmax (μg/mL)  26.767 (1.026)  68.550 (10.345)  157.250 (15.064)  \ntmax (h) 0.687 (0.535)  0.050 (0.029)  0.540 (0.526)  \nAUC 0-168h (μg·h/mL)  1257.943 (88.568)  4110.428 (951.884)  10995.273 (1594.856)  \nAUC 0-inf (μg·h/mL)  1271.923 (63.245)  4521.940 (1181.627)  14107.898 (2342.115)  \nCL t (mL/h)  78.753 (3.993)  47.358 (16.074)  28.960 (4.924)  \nVd ss (L) 3.907 (0.467)  3.088 (0.526)  3.085 (0.332)  \nMRT (h)  49.487 (3.991)  68.003 (13.810)  107.520 (8.158)  \nt1/2 (h) 34.347 (3.332)  47.498 (9.376)  75.805 (6.986)  \nλz (h-1) 0.02030 (0.00208)  0.01503 (0.00305)  0.00920 (0.00085)  \nN, number of patients  \n \n5.54 Immunogenicity  \n \nThe immunogenicity of nimotuzumab was evaluated in eight clinical trials using a qualitative \nELISA assay.

Samples for immunogenicity (HAMA) \nanalysis were collected before starting the study and on days 7, 28, 49 and 70. HAMA was negative \nin all patients.  \n \n5.54.2  Study No. DE766 -A-J201/08 -TH-8201 (Gastric)  \n \nThe immunogenicity of nimotuzumab was evaluated as part of this phase II clinical trial in 38 \npatients with advanced gastric cancer ( Section 5. 9).  Blood samples for immunogenicity (HAHA) \nanalysis were collected prior to the first administration, on Day 43, and at study discontinuation. \nHAHA was negative in all patients.  \n \n \n5.54.3  Study No. DE766 -A-J302 (terminated early, Gastric)  \nThe immunogenicity of nimotuzumab was evaluated as part of this phase III clinical trial in 163 \npatients with advanced gastric cancer ( Section 5. 10).  Blood samples for immunogenicity (HAHA) \nanalysis were collected in the combination group, prior to the first administration of nimotuzumab \ninfusion and before infusion at day 29 (± 7 days) as possible. On Day 29, 1 subject (0.6%) was \npositive for HAHA.  \n \n5.54.4  Study No. IIC RD EC -053 (Anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme).  \n \nPatients with anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme treated with nimotuzumab \nin conjunction with radiotherapy in a multi -center, open -label, Phase I/II clinical trial were \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 85 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         assessed for immunogenic response to nimotuzumab as part of a safety and efficacy study ( Section \n5.16). The anti -idiotypic immune response against nimotuzumab was evaluated before starting \ntreatment, biweekly during the 6 weeks of treatment and then monthly during the follow up period \nusing an ELISA method.  One patient developed antibodies to nimotuzumab.  \n \n5.54.5  Study No. IIC RD EC -040 (SCCHN)  \n \nImmunogenicity was assessed in 14 patients with unresectable advanced head and neck \nsquamous cell carcinomas in a non -randomized, open -label trial of nimotuzumab treatment in \ncombination with radiotherapy ( Section 5.23). Blood samples were collected every 15 days \nthrough the first 6 weeks and monthly thereafter, to test for the presence of antibodies.  One patient \ntreated with 400 mg of nimotuzumab with concomitant radiotherapy developed antibodies to \nnimotuzumab.  However, there was no evidence of exacerbated toxicity in this patient compared \nto non -positive patien ts.  This patient achieved a complete response following clinical evaluation \nof treatment.  \n \n5.54.6  Study No. IIC RD EC -055 (SCCHN)  \n \nAs part of this Phase II/III study in patients with SCCHN (Section 5.28), immunogenicity was \nevaluated in 52 patients: 28 treated with the monoclonal and 24 treated with the placebo. Samples \nfor immunogenicity (HAMA) analysis were taken every 2 weeks within the first 6 treatment \nweeks, and later, monthly until 1 year. Positive HAMA response was detected in three patients \ntreated with nimotuzumab (10.7%) and in one patient receiving placebo (4.2%). No significant \ndifferences were found between groups, which confirm the low immunogenicity of the an tibody \nafter humanization.  \n \n5.54.7  Study No. IIC RD EC -035 (Epithelial Tumor s) \n \nThe immunogenicity of nimotuzumab was evaluated as part of this Phase I clinical trial in 11 \npatients (a sample was not obtained for 1 patient) with advanced tumor s of epithelial origin \n(Section 5. 45).  Immunogenicity data for 8 patients was obtained 1 month after the administration \nof nimotuzumab. No patients expressed human anti -human antibodies (HAHA) response to \nnimotuzumab administered at single doses of 50 to 400 mg via intravenous infusion.  \n \n5.54.8  Study No. DE766 -A-J101 (Solid Tumor s) \n \nThe immunogenicity of nimotuzumab was evaluated as part of this Phase I clinical trial in 12 \npatients with solid tumor s (Section 5. 47).  Blood samples for immunogenicity (HAHA) analysis \nwere collected prior to the first administration and at the end of Course 1 (or during the post -\nobservation period). Subsequent sampling was conducted at least once every 2 courses. HAHA \nwas negative in all patients.  \n \n5.55 Overall Safety  \n \nFor the completed clinical studies, related adverse events are provided by study in Appendix \nB.

of 249 \n(Confidential Information )          \n6 SUMMARY OF DATA AND GUIDANCE FOR INVESTIGATOR  \n \nNimotuzumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody directed against the human \nEpidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), developed by InnoCIMAb as a therapeutic drug \nfor the treatment of cancers of epithelial origin and gliomas.  Nimotuzumab recognizes the \nhuman EGFR, thereby blocking the binding of EGF and TGF , the two principal ligands for \nthis receptor. This action results in an antagonistic biological activity, which  inhibits cell \nproliferation.  Nimotuzumab is in the class of EGF -targeting drugs, which  have repeatedly \ndemonstrated their ability to enhance the effect of radiation.  \nTo support the safety of nimotuzumab, nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and \ntoxicology studies have been conducted  with the drug .  \nImmunohistochemical analysis, conducted using normal fetal, normal adult, and tumor  \ntissues, revealed high and staining intensity of nimotuzumab in tissues with high levels of \nEGFR and demonstrated that nimotuzumab recognizes a large number of tumor  tissues, \nincluding some breast carcinomas, anaplastic astrocytoma, and glioblastoma multiforme \ntissue. Flow cytometry studies have revealed that nimotuzumab specifically recognizes \nEGFR/HER -1 but not HER -2, HER -3 or HER -4.  Furthermore, nimotuzumab requir es \nbivalent binding for efficient accumulation on the cell surface.  \nBlocking EGFR signaling may not be the only mechanism of action underlying \nnimotuzumab efﬁcacy. Additional in vitro studies demonstrated that nimotuzumab may exert \nits effects partially through antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), \ncomplement -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and proliferation inhibition mechanisms.  \nOne of these studies demonstrated that nimotuzumab is able to kill EGFR+ tumor cells \nby NK cell -mediated ADCC. Nimotuzumab -activated NK cells promoted DC maturation \nand EGFR -speciﬁc CD8+ T cell priming. Interestingly, nimotuzumab led to upregulation of \nsome immune checkpoint molecules on NK cells (TIM -3) and DC (PD -L1), to a lower extent \nthan cetuximab did. Furthermore, circulating EGFR -speciﬁc T cells were identiﬁed in \nnimotuzumab -treated HNSCC patients. Notably, nimotuzumab combined with cisplatin -\nbased c hemotherapy and radiation increased the frequency of peripheral \nCD4+CD39+FOXP3+Tregs which otherwise decreased  to baseline values when \nnimotuzumab was used as monotherapy. The frequency of circulating NK cells remained \nconstant during treatment. Moreover, nimotuzumab -induced, NK cell -mediated DC priming \nled to induction of anti -EGFR speciﬁc T cells in HNSCC patien ts. These results suggested a \npotential association between EGFR -specific T cells and long-term clinical benefits \nobserved in some patients treate d with nimotuzumab in clinical studies.  \nIn vitro  studies using the A431 cell line demonstrated that nimotuzumab exhibited potent \nantiproliferative activity and down regulation of VEGF.  Analysis of the DNA profile \nrevealed that nimotuzumab induced cell cycle arrest during the G1 phase of cell division, \nwith an accompanying decrease in number of cells in the S phase.  Data from these in vitro \nstudies suggest that nimotuzumab acts mainly as a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic agent in \nvitro .  In addition, in vitro  studies have demonstrated that nimotuzuma b inhibits EGF -\ndependent EGFR phosphorylation as well as increasing the radiosensitivity of NSCLC cell \nlines expressing high or moderate levels of EGFR.  \nNimotuzumab inhibited tumor  growth and angiogenesis, and induced apoptosis of A431 \nhuman vulvar epidermoid carcinoma xenografts in SCID mice. When administered in \ncombination with radiotherapy, nimotuzumab significantly delayed tumor  growth, inhibited \nangiogenesis, reduced the tumor  proliferation index, increased the number of apoptotic cells \nand reduced the phosphorylation activity of the EGF receptor in NMRI mice implanted with \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 100 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         U87MG glioma xenografts. The antiangiogenic activity of the antibody, largely \ndemonstrated in the U87MG model, would be in part responsible to the ability of the \nnimotuzumab to target the radioresistant cancer stem population CD133+ cells, increasing \nthe efficacy of radiation when administered concomitant. In vitro  studies performed in this \nmodel has shown both molecules being colocalized on the surface of the tumor cells, \nproviding a plausible explanation to the targeting of this population.  \nNimotuzumab in combination with radiation inhibited tumor  growth in athymic mice \nimplanted with H292 and Ma -1 xenografts, which  express high or moderate levels of EGFR. \nIn addition, the combination of CPT -11 plus nimotuzumab showed greater inhibition of \ntumor  growth in athymic mice implanted with gastric GCIY xenografts compared to single \nagent administration. Most recently , in vivo  studies on which nimotuzumab was used as \nmonotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel or carboplatin on NCI -H292 human lung \nmucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line xenografted into nude mice has shown antitumor effect, \nwhen nimotuzumab was used as monotherapy and this antitumor effect was significantly \nincreased with the combination with paclitaxel or carboplatin.  \nSingle -dose pharmacokinetic studies performed in mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys and \nbaboons. Pharmacokinetic studies conducted in male green monkeys demonstrated that \nnimotuzumab produced by ST fermentation technology had a comparable pharmacokinetic \nprofile  to nimotuzumab produced by HF fermentation technology.  \nBiodistribution studies in xenograft models of human cell lines have been used to evaluate \nthe ability of nimotuzumab to bind to human tumor s in vivo .  Single -dose biodistribution \nstudies were carried out using 99mTc or 188Re in xenograft mouse models (H125 lung \nadenocarcinoma, U -87 human glioblastoma multiforme, A431 human vulvar epidermoid \ncarcinoma, MDA -MB-468 human breast carcinoma cell lines).  The tumor  uptake data for \nnimotuzumab suggests  that there is a threshold number of EGFR per cell above which this \nantibody (with a binding affinity in the order of 10-9 M) will bind tumor  cells in vivo  and \nwill accumulate in the xenografted tumor s, and below wh ich the antibody will not bind or \naccumulate in the xenografted tumor s. \nAcute toxicity studies conducted in rats at dose levels up to 57.14 mg/kg (10 times the \nmaximum human dose of 400 mg) demonstrated nimotuzumab administration caused only \nminor effects limited to transient increases in body temperature. No adverse events we re \nseen in acute toxicity studies in monkeys at dose levels up to 50.00 mg/kg. Repeated -dose \ntoxicity studies at comparable dose levels were also not associated with signs of systemic \ntreatment -related toxicity. Two 14 -day repeated dose toxicity studies we re conducted in \nmonkeys at dose levels of up to 11.4 mg/kg/day. Daily intravenous administration of \nnimotuzumab at dose levels of 11.4  mg/kg/day for 14 days in monkeys was associated with \nminimal toxicity, including discrete interstitial inflammation of th e heart with a high \nlymphocyte population in both male and female treated animals and increased fat droplets \nin the hepatocytes of some male treated animals. A 6 -month repeated dose toxicity study \nwas conducted in green monkeys at dose levels of up to 28.6  mg/kg body weight/week.  \nStatistically significant, non -dose-dependent  differences in body temperature, respiratory \nrate, hematological, and clinical chemistry parameters were observed.  A second repeated \ndose toxicity study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels up to 50 mg/kg.  \nIt was concluded that repeated we ekly intravenous administration of nimotuzumab for 26 \nweeks in monkeys was not associated with any significant toxicological findings or evidence \nof detrimental pharmacological effects.  A local tolerance study in female rabbits at dose \nlevels of up to 5 -fold the proposed human dose showed that intravenously administered \nnimotuzumab did not induce irritation, suggesting that irritation is not expected to result \nfrom clinical infusion of t he therapeutic product at the proposed doses. In vitro  cardiotoxicity \nNimotuzumab Investigator’s Brochure  Confidential  \nProperty of InnoCIMAb PTE LTD  Version 20.0  \nPage 101 of 249 \n(Confidential Information )         studies performed in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with hERG demonstrated \nthat nimotuzumab has a hERG inhibition safety margin of over 30 times the maximal serum \nconcentration expected from normal therapeutic exposure.  \nNimotuzumab efficacy results have been formally reported in 40 Phase I to II/III clinical \nstudies, primarily conducted in adult patients with late -stage cancers, mainly squamous cell \ncarcinomas of the head and neck, breast, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, hepatic cancer, \nnasopharyngeal, non -small cell lung, pancreas,  prostate and various solid tumor s, anaplastic \nastrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme. In these trials, nimotuzumab was administered \nby intravenous infusion over 30 to 60 minutes at doses of 5 0, 100, 200, 400, 800 or 1200 mg \nonce weekly with or without concomitant radiotherapy or chemotherapy or \nchemoradiotherapy.  \nThe most extensive clinical evaluation of nimotuzumab has been done in squamous cell \ncarcinoma of the head and neck, in non -small cell lung cancer and in anaplastic astrocytoma  \nand glioblastoma multiform. Eleven of the completed clinical trials with nimotuzumab have \nbeen conducted in patients with high-grade  glioma, either in pediatric or adult population. \nFour of the completed studies were conducted in pediatric glioma, 2 in recurrent or relapsed \nhigh-grade glioma, 1 in recurrent diffuse  intrinsic pontine glioma and 2 as first line treatment \non newly diagnosed diffuse  intrinsic pontine glioma. In these trials, nimotuzumab was \ninfused intravenously at a dose of 150 mg/m2 body surface area over 30 minutes, once \nweekly. Nimotuzumab was dosed on a body weight basis due to the large variation of body \nweights in this patient population.  \n  \nThe efficacy of nimotuzumab treatment was evaluated based on WHO or NCI RECIST \nand is summarized by each individual study in Table 11 . \n \nTable 11: Summary of Efficacy Results from Completed Studies . \n \nStudy Number (Location) /  \nNo. of Patients  Study Treatment

Initially, the case was assessed as \nunrelated to nimotuzumab because the patient has known cardiovascular disease (peripheral arterial \ndisease), The patient was hospital ized to exclude acute coronary events . \n• Patient 01 -03-RP experienced asymptomatic elevated troponin level and was hospitalized for observation. \nThe SAE case is not included in Table D -1 because the casual relationship to nimotuzumab was assessed as \nunlikely related. He was discharged as well the next day after transfusion and troponin level decreased.  \n• Patient 02 -05-RP experienced asymptomatic troponin increase to 0.06 from the baseline but this was still \nwithin normal limits. The event did not cause/prolong hospitalization, did not result in death, was not life -\nthreatening, did not result in disability/ incapacity, did not result in congenital anomaly/birth defect, and did \nnot cause other medically important condition.

METHODS: This open-\nlabel, investigator-initiated, phase 3, randomized trial was conducted from 2012 to 2018. Adult patients with locally advanced head \nand neck cancer who were fit for radical chemoradiation were randomized 1:1 to receive either radical radiotherapy (66-70 grays) \nwith concurrent weekly cisplatin (30 mg/m2) (CRT) or the same schedule of CRT with weekly nimotuzumab (200 mg) (NCRT).\nThe primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); key secondary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS), duration of  \nlocoregional control (LRC), and overall survival (OS). An intent-to-treat analysis also was performed. RESULTS: In total, 536 patients \nwere allocated equally to both treatment arms. The median follow-up was 39.13 months. The addition of nimotuzumab improved PFS \n(hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.89; P  = .004), LRC (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50-0.89; P  = .006), and DFS (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-\n0.92; P = .008) and had a trend toward improved OS (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65-1.08; P  = .163). Grade 3 through 5 adverse events were \nsimilar between the 2 arms, except for a higher incidence of mucositis in the NCRT arm (66.7% vs 55.8%; P  = .01). CONCLUSIONS: \nThe addition of nimotuzumab to concurrent weekly CRT improves PFS, LRC, and DFS. This combination provides a novel alternative \ntherapeutic option to a 3-weekly schedule of 100 mg/m2 cisplatin in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer who are \ntreated with radical-intent CRT.

Adult patients with newly diagnosed, treatment-\nnaive, nonmetastatic, stage III or IV LAHNSCC aris -\ning in the oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx, or oral cavity were eligible. The other eligibility criteria were \na Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 and adequate he -\nmatologic, renal, and hepatic function. Patients with tumors originating in the nasopharynx, salivary gland, \nor nasal cavity and those who had received immuno -\ntherapy or prior radiotherapy to the head and neck re -\ngion were excluded. The study protocol was approved by \nthe Institutional Ethics Committee and was registered \nwith the Clinical Trial Registry of India (trial registration \nidentifier CTRI/2014/09/004980). It was conducted ac -\ncording to the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice guidelines, and it was monitored by the TMC \nData Safety and Monitoring Committee.\nStudy Procedures\nBefore randomization, patients underwent a comprehen -\nsive head and neck examination, blood tests (complete \nhemogram, renal function, and liver function), imaging of \nthe head and neck region (either contrast-enhanced com -\nputed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), chest radiogram, electrocardiogram, and pure tone audiometry. \nPatients were staged according to the American Joint \nCommittee on Cancer-Union for International Cancer Control staging system (seventh edition). Patients with a lymph node status ≥ N2 underwent whole-body positron \nemission tomography-computed tomography to rule out distant metastasis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) status \nwas examined in the tissue biopsy using immunohisto -\nchemistry for p16.\n14 All patients had nutritional, speech, \nswallowing, and dental assessments, and deficiencies noted were managed accordingly. Stratified block, cen -\ntral randomization for 5 factors was performed by an  independent statistician, and patients were randomized \n1:1 to either the cisplatin-radiation arm (CRT) or the  \nnimotuzumab plus cisplatin-radiation arm (NCRT). These factors were site of malignancy (oropharynx vs \nothers), stage (stage III vs IV), age ( ≤60 vs > 60 years), \n radiation technique (conventional vs others), and treat -\nment center.\nHigh-dose, curative radiotherapy was administered \nin both arms over 6.5 to 7 weeks. Irradiation was planned \nusing a standard 2-dimensional technique, a 3-  dimensional  \nconformal technique, or intensity-modulated radiother -\napy with megavoltage radiation. Gross tumor and lymph \nnode disease received 70 grays (Gy), in 2 Gy per fraction, \n5 days per week. Uninvolved nodal regions of the neck \nwere treated to a dose of 46 to 50 Gy. Other altered frac -\ntionation schedules were permitted if the biologic equiva -\nlent dose for tumor control was similar to 70 Gy at 2 Gy \nper fraction. Quality assurance was done before com -\nmencement and during radiation treatment; plans and \ndoses were cross-checked and confirmed by the radiation \noncology study members (for protocol, see supporting \n information [Clinical Therapy Protocol, Appendix IV]).\nIn both arms, cisplatin was dosed at 30 mg/m\n2 \nweekly during radiation along with supportive medi -\ncation. Nimotuzumab was administered weekly in the \nNCRT arm intravenously as a 200-mg flat dose in 250 mL \nnormal saline over 60 minutes without premedication. \nPatients underwent a comprehensive clinical examina -\ntion and positron emission tomography-computed tomography 8 weeks after the completion of chemora -\ndiation. If residual or recurrent disease was  resectable, \nthese patients were offered surgical resection. Wherever feasible, residual, progressive, or recurrent disease was \npathologically confirmed. Patients who were not willing \nto undergo surgery or who had unresectable disease were \noffered palliative chemotherapy.\nStudy Endpoints\nPFS was the primary outcome and was defined as  duration \nfrom the date of randomization to the date of progres -\nsion (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid \n 10970142, 2019, 18, Downloaded from https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.32179 by INASP/HINARI - INDONESIA, Wiley Online Library on [30/10/2022].

Secondary  outcomes \nwere locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival \n(DFS), OS, treatment compliance, adverse events, and \nquality of life. Duration of LRC was defined as the \ntime between the date of randomization and the date \nof  locoregional failure. DFS was defined as the period \nafter treatment completion when the patient experienced complete remission. For patients who achieved complete  \nremission after therapy, DFS was calculated from the date of response assessment to the date of recurrence (either \nlocoregional or distant). For patients with residual dis -\nease who underwent salvage surgery, DFS was calculated from date of salvage surgery to the date of recurrence. \nIn all other patients, DFS was considered zero. OS was \ncalculated as the time from the date of randomization to \nthe date of death. Adverse events were graded according \nto the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology \nCriteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03).\nSample Size\nA 2-year PFS rate of 60% in the CRT arm was  \nassumed.16,17 With an α of 5%, power of 80%, and a \ndropout rate of 10%, we required 536 patients in the \nstudy to demonstrate an absolute increase in PFS by \n12%. An interim analysis without an α spending func -\ntion for monitoring early efficacy was planned after 4 years. However, it was never performed because the \nstudy recruited slowly.\nStatistical Methods\nThe statistical software packages R (version 3.1.2;  \nR Foundation for Statistical Computing) and SPSS (ver -\nsion 20; SPSS Inc) were used for analysis. Outcomes were \nanalyzed using the intention-to-treat method. Median \nfollow-up was calculated using the reverse Kaplan-Meier \nmethod. Descriptive statistics were performed for base -\nline characteristics, treatment compliance, locoregional response, and adverse events. These were compared be -\ntween the 2 groups using either the chi-square test or the Fisher test. PFS, DFS, LRC, and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Brookmeyer and \nCrowley method was used for the construction of 95% \nCIs, and time-to-event curves were compared using the \nlog rank test. A Cox proportional hazard model with the \nEfron method of tie handling was used for calculating \nthe hazard rate with 95% CIs. The proportional hazard \nmodel assumptions were checked using Schoenfeld resid -\nuals. A P value ≤ .05 was considered as significant.\nA post hoc sensitivity analysis was performed using  \n2 methods. The first method was a competing risk analysis for PFS, DFS, and LRC, and the second method was a \nrepeat analysis using a composite endpoint  (inclusive of \ndeath) for PFS (progression or death), LRC  (locoregional \nprogression or death), and DFS (progression or death) \nto confirm the robustness of the results. A multivariate \nanalysis was performed for PFS, DFS, LRC, and OS with \nknown prognostic factors (age, site of malignancy, stage, \nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance sta -\ntus, and radiation technique) using Cox regression anal -\nysis. Because HPV status is an important prognostic \nfactor in oropharyngeal cancers, we performed a post hoc subgroup analysis to address the effect of the interaction \n between nimotuzumab and HPV status on outcomes.\nRESULTS\nBaseline Characteristics\nBetween 2012 and 2018, 536 patients were randomized \nequally between both arms (268 in each). The median \nduration of follow-up was 39.13 months (39.5 months \nin the CRT arm vs 39.0 months in the NCRT arm). \nThe Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials flow \ndiagram in Figure 1 provides the details of enrollment, \nallocation of intervention, follow-up, and data analysis. \nBaseline patient and tumor characteristics were balanced \nbetween the arms (Table 1).\nAdverse Events\nAll adverse events occurred with similar frequency in the \n2 arms except mucositis and thrombocytopenia (Table 2). \nHospitalization because of toxicities was higher in the \nNCRT arm (58 patients; 21.6%) versus the CRT arm (41 \npatients; 15.3%; P = .058). Nasogastric tubes were placed \nin 97 patients (36.2%) in CRT arm versus 102 patients (38.1%) in the NCRT arm ( P = .655).\nTreatment\nThe details of radiation and chemotherapy compli -\nance are shown in Table 3. A cumulative cisplatin dose ≥200 mg/m\n2 was administered to 211 patients (78.7%) \nin the CRT arm and to 208 patients (77.6%) in the NCRT arm ( P = .754).\nOutcomes\nProgression-free survival\nTwo hundred thirty-five patients experienced disease \nprogression, including 134 in the CRT arm and 101 in \nthe NCRT arm. The sites of progression in the CRT \narm were locoregional in 105 patients (39.2%), distant \nin 24 patients (9%), and both in 5 patients (1.9%).

The 2-year OS was 63.8% (95% CI, 57.3%-\n69.6%) and 57.7% (95% CI, 51.3%-63.6%) in the NCRT and CRT arms, respectively. Details of causes \nof deaths in each arm are shown in Table 4. The impact \nof nimotuzumab on various subgroups is depicted in \nFigure 4; and, for patients who received a cumulative \ncisplatin dose ≥ 200 mg/m\n2, the impact was similar to \nthat in the overall results (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.62-1.13; P = .237). The impact of various prognostic \nfactors on OS is shown in the supporting information (see Supporting Table 1). Among the tested factors, the \npresence of stage III disease ( P = .001) was associated \nwith improved OS.\nSalvage Surgery for Residual Disease\nObjective responses postchemoradiation were evaluable in 239 patients (89.2%) in the CRT arm and 233 pa -\ntients (86.9%) in the NCRT arm ( P = .424). The over -\nall response rate among evaluable patients was 89.1% \n(n = 213) in the CRT arm versus 89.3% (n = 208) in the \nNCRT arm. A complete response post-treatment com -\npletion was documented in 62.7% of patients in the CRT \narm (n = 168) and in 61.6% of patients (n = 165) in \nthe NCRT arm. Salvage surgery for residual disease was \nplanned in the multidisciplinary clinic for 72  patients, \nincluding 34 in the CRT am and 38 in the NCRT arm. Of the 34 patients in the CRT arm, 22 underwent sal -\nvage surgery, 5 progressed before salvage surgery, and  \n7 patients refused surgery. The 22 salvage surgeries per -\nformed were neck lymph node dissection in 16 patients, local excision in 2 patients, and both local excision and \nneck lymph node dissection in 4 patients. Of the 38 \n patients in the NCRT arm, 26 underwent salvage sur -\ngery, 5 progressed before salvage surgery, and 7 patients refused surgery. The 26 salvage surgeries performed were \nneck lymph node dissection in 13 patients, local exci -\nsion in 1 patient, and both local excision and neck lymph node dissection in 12 patients.\nHPV Status and Outcomes\nThe HPV status of oropharyngeal cancers is shown in \nTable 1. There was a significant interaction between HPV \nstatus and treatment outcomes (see Supporting Table 2). \nThe hazard ratio for PFS in p16-negative oropharyngeal \ncancers was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.36-0.79), whereas hazard \nratio for p16-positive cancers was 2.6 (95% CI, 0.57-11.9). \nThe 2-year PFS was 31.5% (95% CI, 21.5%-42.0%) in \nthe CRT arm and 57.2% (95% CI, 45.8%-67.1%) in the \nNCRT arm in patients with p16-negative oropharyngeal \ncancers ( P = .001). A similar higher magnitude of  benefit \nwas observed with regard to DFS (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.82; P = .006), LRC (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI,  \n0.4-0.94; P = .024), and OS (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% \nCI, 0.43-0.92; P = .018). The 2-year OS was 39%  \n(95% CI, 28.3%-49.6%) in the CRT arm and 57.6% (95% CI, 46.3%-67.4%) in the NCRT arm in patients \nwith p16-negative oropharyngeal cancers.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this first phase 3 study with nimotuzumab, we found \nthat its addition to cisplatin prolonged PFS compared \nwith cisplatin alone in patients with LAHNSCC who \n received radical chemoradiation. The addition of nimo -\ntuzumab improved 2-year PFS and decreased the haz -\nard of progression by 31%. Similar benefits also were \nobserved in the time to LRC and DFS. The improve -\nment in OS was not significant. However, OS was not the primary endpoint of the study, and data currently are \nimmature for this comparison.\nStudies have shown that EGFR antibodies did not \nimprove outcomes when added to cisplatin in patients TABLE 4.

In that study, subgroup analysis \nrevealed that the addition of cetuximab led to a trend \ntoward improved outcomes in young patients, those with \nHPV-negative tumors of the oropharynx or hypopharynx, \nand the T4 subgroup. However, the proportion of these \n patients in RTOG 0522 was in the minority. Seventy per -\ncent of patients in that study had primary tumors in the \n oropharynx, and only 27% of these were HPV-negative. \nThe hypopharynx as a site of primary malignancy was \n present in 6.9% of patients. Compared with those find -\nings, in our study, these characteristics were present in the  \nmajority of patients (Table 1). Our post hoc subgroup \nanalysis in p16-  negative patients further strengthened \nthis assumption. The use of nimotuzumab in this cohort  \nof patients led to a decrease in the risk of progression \nby nearly 50%, which translated into a decrease in the \nrisk of death by 37%. Hence we believe that our results \necho the findings of the RTOG 0522 subgroup analy -\nsis and the  recently reported GORTEC (the French  \nHead and Neck Radiation Oncology Group) study,18 \nsuggesting that younger patients and those with  adverse \nprognostic features typically benefit from the nimo -\ntuzumab-weekly cisplatin concurrent combination (lighter CRT). Second, in the RTOG 0522 study, con -\ncurrent cetuximab with cisplatin led to more  adverse \nevents, which, in turn, led to more toxicity-related  \nradiation interruptions (26.9% vs 15.1%, respectively).\n9 \nRadiation interruptions and delays during concurrent chemoradiation are known adverse prognostic factors.\n19 \nThird, nimotuzumab is molecularly and biologically different from cetuximab\n20 and panitumumab.21 Drugs \nwith similar mechanisms of action are known to have differential impacts.\n22 Nimotuzumab inhibits both \n ligand-dependent and ligand-independent signaling of \nthe EGFR pathway.23\nThe control arm in our study demonstrated a 3-year \nPFS of 45.8%, which appears to be lower than the rates in other similar randomized studies from North America \n(which has a predominant HPV-positive population) but \nsimilar to the rates in HPV-negative cohorts in the litera -\nture.\n9,24-27 Furthermore, our patients had a high propor -\ntion of hypopharyngeal primaries, high rates of tobacco use (86.5%), and almost one-fifth had gross perinodal \nextension, all of which are recognized adverse prognostic \nfeatures.\n28-31\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network guide -\nlines recommend 3-weekly or weekly cisplatin as standard treatment options.32 We used weekly cispla -\ntin in this study, and it is used worldwide, especially in head and neck cancer-endemic regions ( >85% of \ncenters), at doses from 30 to 40 mg/m\n2.33-37 This use \nas routine practice is reflected in Asian guidelines,38 \nIndian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guide -\nlines,39 the evidence-based guidelines of TMC,40 and \nin multiple randomized studies from this region.33,34,36 \nWe reported a benefit of 3-weekly cisplatin over weekly cisplatin. However, this benefit was predominantly \n applicable in the adjuvant setting and for oral cavity \ncancer and is not applicable to the patients in the cur -\nrent study.\n41\nA cumulative cisplatin dose of 200 mg/m2 provides \nadequate antitumor effects.41 In the Meta-Analysis of \nChemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer (MACH-NC) \nanalysis, among the variety of monocisplatin schedules \ncombined with radiation, negative results were obtained \nonly in a single study, which used a cumulative cispla -\ntin dose of 140 mg/m2, a dose much below the desired \nlevel of 200 mg/m2.3,42 Similar findings were echoed in \na meta-analysis reported by Ghi et al,43 who found no \ndifference in the hazard rate of death between groups \nof patients who received cumulative doses of cisplatin \n≤300  mg/m2. However, the hazard rate was markedly \nincreased when the cumulative dose of cisplatin was \n<150 mg/m2 compared with cisplatin doses between \n200 and 225 mg/m2.43 The proportion of patients who \n received cumulative dose of cisplatin ≥ 200 mg/m2 in the \ncurrent study was 78.7% in the CRT arm and 77.6% \nin the NCRT arm (Table 3). The corresponding rate in \nthe RTOG studies and in other major studies ranged \n between 62.5% and 88.5%.5,9,44,45 Furthermore, a post \nhoc analysis confirmed that the benefit seen with nimo -\ntuzumab also was observed in patients who received \n cisplatin ≥200 mg/m2.\nAdverse event rates were similar between the 2 \narms except for a higher incidence of grade ≥3 mucosi -\ntis, which was seen with the addition of nimotuzumab. \nHowever, this did not hamper the treatment delivery. The \nlack of EGFR-specific side effects is courtesy of its lower \naffinity for EGFR receptor and hence a higher specificity \nfor tumor binding because as it has a higher density of \nEGFR receptor than skin and other normal organs.46,47\nThere are certain limitations in this study. This \nwas a single-center study, and the accrual took 6 years. However, no major changes have occurred over the last \ndecade in chemoradiation for head and neck cancers. \nThe stratification was not according to HPV status. \nThe incidence is low in the Indian population (range, \n 10970142, 2019, 18, Downloaded from https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.32179 by INASP/HINARI - INDONESIA, Wiley Online Library on [30/10/2022].

There were disproportionately higher numbers of hypopharyngeal cancers (which carry a poor prognosis) in the NCRT arm, but this does not affect the study conclusions. The dose of 100 mg/m\n2 3 weekly \nwas not used as a standard, hence the additional impact of nimotuzumab with this dose remains unknown.\nThe radiation schedules and techniques in this study \nwere standard; therefore, these results are generalizable, especially in centers where weekly cisplatin radiosensiti -\nzation is used.\n49 The follow-up for OS is immature, hence \nthe data for OS need to be interpreted with caution.\nConclusion\nThe addition of nimotuzumab to concurrent weekly cis -\nplatin and chemoradiotherapy improves PFS, LRC, and DFS. Three-weekly cisplatin with radiotherapy remains the preferred option of treatment, and this combination provides a novel alternative therapeutic option when weekly cisplatin is used.\nFUNDING SUPPORT\nThis study was funded by Biocon Ltd, Science and Engineering Research \nBoard grant EMR/2015/001591, and by the Tata Memorial Center Research Administration Council.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES\nSameer Vasant Chaudhari is an employee of Biocon Ltd and reports per -\nsonal fees and nonfinancial support from the company outside the submit -\nted work.

Therefore, we conducted a phase III clinical study to verify\nthe efﬁcacy and safety of this combination regimen in patients with K-Ras wild-\ntype tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov identi ﬁer:NCT02395016 ).\nPATIENTS AND\nMETHODSEligible patients were randomly assigned to receive nimotuzumab (400 mg\nonce per week) or placebo followed by gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2on days 1, 8,\nand 15, once every 4 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nThe primary end point was overall survival (OS) and the secondary end pointswere progression-free survival (PFS), response rates, and safety.\nRESULTS A total of 480 patients were screened; 92 patients were enrolled and 82 patients\nwith K-Ras wild-type tumors were eligible. In the full analysis set, the median\nOS was 10.9 versus 8.5 months, while the restricted mean survival time (RMST)was 18.05 versus 11.14 months for the investigational versus control arm (ratioof control vinvestigation 50.62 [0.40-0.97]; P5.036). Median PFS was 4.2\nversus 3.6 months in the investigational versus control arm (log-rank P5.04;\nhazard ratio, 0.60 [0.37-0.99]) and the restricted mean PFS time was 8.08versus 4.76 months (RMST ratio, 0.58 [0.38-0.90]; P5.036). Both OS and PFS\nwere longer in the nimotuzumab group than in the placebo group. The objective\nresponse rates and disease control rates were 7% versus 10% and 68% versus\n63% for the investigational and control groups, respectively. The incidence ofadverse events were comparable between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION In patients with locally advanced or metastatic K-Ras wild-type PC, nimotu-\nzumab plus gemcitabine signi ﬁcantly improved OS and PFS with a good safety\nproﬁle.\nINTRODUCTION\nPancreatic cancer (PC) is a common and fatal malignancy\nthat occurs worldwide. Eighty percent of PC cases are di-\nagnosed as advanced or metastatic stage.1Twenty- ﬁve\npercent of patients with advanced PC are at a locally ad-vanced stage, with a median overall survival (mOS) of6-9 months. Approximately 60%-70% of patients withadvanced PC are at the metastatic stage, with mOS of only3-5 months.\n2–9Unfortunately, the current regimens are\nunsatisfactory. Encouraging the achievement of new reg-imens has been developed in many other cancer ﬁelds but\nrarely in PC. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective\ntherapies to prolong the survival of patients with PC.Nimotuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal\nantibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR). A phase IIb study (PCS07) done in Germany showedthat nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine might signi ﬁcantly\nimprove the mOS (8.6 months v6.0 months) of locally ad-\nvanced or metastatic PC, especially for the wild-type K-Rasgene subgroup (11.62 months v5.67 months; 1-year survival\nrates, 53.8% v15.8%, respectively).\n10In 2014, gemcitabine was\nwidely used and was considered the standard of care for ﬁrst-\nline treatment regimen for patients with advanced PC inChina. Thus, we conducted a phase III trial (NOTABLE study)to verify the ef ﬁcacy and safety of nimotuzumab plus gem-\ncitabine as ﬁrst-line treatment for patients with locally ad-\nvanced or metastatic PC.ACCOMPANYING CONTENT\nProtocol\nAccepted July 20, 2023\nPublished August 30, 2023\nJ Clin Oncol 00:1-11\n© 2023 by American Society ofClinical Oncology\nView Online\nArticle\nCreative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial No Derivatives\n4.0 License\nascopubs.org/journal/jco | Volume nnn, Issue nnn |1\nDownloaded from ascopubs.org by 66.96.253.194 on September 18, 2023 from 066.096.253.194\nCopyright © 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

The principal investigators from each site adhered to\nthe study protocol. In addition, data were collected andanalyzed by professional third-party statisticians who cer-tiﬁed the accuracy and completeness of the reported data.\nPatents\nPatients with locally advanced or metastatic PC were\nscreened. Each patient signed an informed consent form\nbefore screening.

Thepatients were followed up until death or study completion.\nPatients were strati ﬁed by tumor localization (head, body, or\ntail of the pancreas) according to previous surgery, history ofbiliary obstruction treatment, and adjuvant chemotherapy.\nAssessments\nThe investigators evaluated t he tumor response via computed\ntomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan every8 weeks, according to RECIST ver sion 1.1. The clinical bene ﬁt\nresponse (CBR) was evaluated every 8 weeks on the basis of theBurris criteria.\n13Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse\nevents were monitored by the investigators from the beginningof the treatment and up to 30 days after treatment completion.\nThe detected events were graded according to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03,\n14and\ncoded and summarized according to the preferred terms in theMedical Dictionary for Regulato ry Activities, version 24.0.\nStudy End Points\nThe primary end point was overall survival (OS), de ﬁned as\nthe time from random assignment to death due to anycause. Subgroup analyses of OS were based on prespeci ﬁed\nstratiﬁcation factors. The secondary end points were\nprogression-free survival (PFS), de ﬁned as the time from\nrandom assignment until objective tumor progression ordeath; time to progression (TTP, de ﬁned as the time from\nrandom assignment until objective tumor progression);objective response rate (ORR), including complete responseCONTEXT\nKey Objective\nDoes nimotuzumab (a humanized epithelial growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody) plus gemcitabine regimen provide\nan overall survival (OS) bene ﬁt for patients with locally advanced or metastatic K-Ras wild-type pancreatic cancer (PC)?\nKnowledge Generated\nIn a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, phase III clinical trial in China, patients with locally advanced or metastaticK-Ras wild-type PC were enrolled. The results showed that nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine signi ﬁcantly improved OS and\nprogression-free survival with a good safety pro ﬁle compared with the placebo-gemcitabine group.\nRelevance (E.M.

Treatment-related ad-\nverse events (TRAEs) were de ﬁned as adverse drug reac-\ntions (ADRs).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe primary end point was evaluated in the full analysis set(FAS; all eligible patients who received at least one dose ofnimotuzumab and had one evaluation of ef ﬁcacy). Secondary\nend points were analyzed only in the FAS. A prespeci ﬁed\nsubgroup analysis of OS and PFS was performed using theFAS. Safety analysis was performed using the safety analysisset (SS; patients received at least one antibody dose).\nStatistical analyses were performed using the SAS version\n9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). OS was the primary ef ﬁcacy\nend point and was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier\nmethod and strati ﬁed log-rank test. If the proportional\nhazards assumption was unsatisfactory (eg, survival curvecrossover), the restricted mean survival time (RMST)model\n15was used to analyze the survival bene ﬁt differ-\nence. RMST is suggested as a novel alternative measure insurvival analyses and may be us eful when the proportional\nhazards assumption cannot be made. A right-censored\np a t t e r nw a su s e df o rt h eO Sd a t a .T h et i m ep o i n to ft h e\nRMST model was the closest to the end of the trial.\nWe calculated that, with a sample of 276 patients, the study\nwould have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) fordeath with nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine (investigationalarm, or nimotuzumab-gemcitabine) versus placebo plusgemcitabine (control arm, or placebo-gemcitabine) of 0.69.\nThis estimation was based on the results of the full pop-\nulation in the PCS07 study, where the median OS of thegemcitabine monotherapy group was 6 months and themedian OS of the investigational arm was 8.7 months. Sincepatients with K-Ras wild-type PC were rare and recruitmentwas dif ﬁcult, we calculated that with a sample of 79 patients\nand 64 events, the study would have 80% power to detecta HR for death with nimotuzumab-gemcitabine versus\nplacebo-gemcitabine. This assumption was made on the\nbasis of the result of patients with K-Ras wild-type PC inPCS07 study, where the median OS of gemcitabine mono-therapy group was 5.67 months, and the median survival ofthe investigational group was 11.62 months. The sample sizere-estimation was approved by the Chinese regulatory au-thorities. At the time of approval, 92 patients were enrolledand the study was terminated.\nMultivariate analysis of survival data was conducted using\nthe Cox proportional hazard model according to prespeci ﬁed\nstratiﬁcation factors to evaluate the treatment effect. In\naddition to the HR as a measurement of the relative risk of anevent, the RMST ratio between arms (control vinvestigation)\nwas estimated after adjusting for covariates. For this anal-\nysis, a ratio of <1 indicated survival improvement in theinvestigational arm. Unlike the HR, the RMST ratio does not\nrely on any model assumption.\n16\nThe ORR was analyzed using the Fisher test, while the DCRand CBR were evaluated using the chi-squared test. AEs wereclassiﬁed according to the system organ class, preferred\nterm, or severity grade.\nRESULTS\nPatients and Treatment Groups\nA total of 480 patients from 25 study sites in China werescreened between April 2015 and March 2021. Then, 92patients with the K-Ras wild-type gene were eligible for\nrandom assignment, and 90 patients were allocated for\ntreatment. Eight patients who did not have K-Ras wild-typetumors according to a gene con ﬁrmatory procedure (seven\ncases) or PC (one gallbladder carcinoma case), detectedduring monitoring, were excluded. Finally, 82 patients wereanalyzed as part of the FAS, and 41 were included in eachgroup. The FAS group was the modi ﬁed intent-to-treat\ngroup ( Fig 1 ).\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline\nwere well balanced between the two groups ( Table 1 ).\nEfﬁcacy\nOS\nThe OS analysis was based on 76 deaths, including 36 deaths\nin the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group and 40 deaths in theplacebo-gemcitabine group. The mean follow-up time was57.6 months and 16.6 months, respectively, for the two\ngroups. The data cutoff was January 27, 2022. The median OS\nwas 10.9 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 16.3) in the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group and 8.5 months (95% CI, 5.7 to 10.0) in theplacebo-gemcitabine group (Cox proportional HR, 0.66; 95%CI, 0.42 to 1.05; log-rank P5.08;Fig 2A ). When using RMST\nmodel, the RMST was 18.05 months (95% CI, 11.71 to 24.38) inthe nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group and 11.14 months (95%CI, 8.07 to 14.20) in the placebo-gemcitabine group (RMST\nratio of control vtreatment, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.97;\nP5.036; Table 2 ).

No grade 4-5 AEs were\nobserved in this trial.\nDISCUSSION\nThis prospective, randomized , controlled, double-blind,\nmulticenter clinical trial demonstrated that nimotuzumabcombined with gemcitabine prolonged the median OS time\nby 2.4 months and decreased the mortality risk by 34%compared with the placebo gr oup by Cox regression. Once\nthe trial was completed, we observed that the survivalcurves overlapped until 6 months and gradually separatedthereafter. In this situation , the proportional hazard as-\nsumption for the Cox regression model does not hold.\nConsequently, it is not a robust method. Subsequently, weused the RMST model to calculate the survival differencesbetween the two curves using the RMST ratio, which behavesas an analog of the Cox proportional HR. The mortality riskdecreased by 38%, which was equivalent to RMST ratio 0.62(0.40-0.97) calculated at the placebo-gemcitabine versusnimotuzumab-gemcitabine direction, and the differences\nwere statistically signi ﬁcant. The RMST for both OS and PFS\nwas signi ﬁcantly longer in the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine\ngroup than in the control group. The 1-year and 3-year OSrates were 43.6% versus 26.8% and 13.9% versus 2.7% inthe investigational and control arms, respectively.

In a previous study, the median OS of gemcitabine\nmonotherapy was 5.65 months.\n13However, the median OS\nwas increased to 6.24 months when combined with\nerlotinib,17and 8.5 months and 1-year OS rate of 35%\nwhen albumin-paclitaxel was added to gemcitabine.18In\naddition to these regimens, the ﬂuorouracil, leucovorin,\nirinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) schedulehad the longest median survival time of 11.1 months;its usage is limited owing to side effects.\n19Compared\nwith the current treatment alternatives, the medianOS of nimotuzumab-gemcit abine in this study was\n10.9 months, and the 1-year OS rate was 43.6%, which was\nequal to that of the FOLFIRINOX regimen, but with abetter safety pro ﬁle.PFS was also signi ﬁcantly higher in the nimotuzumab arm,\naccording to the log-rank Pvalue and RMST method. The\nORRs of the two treatment groups were similar; however, the\nDCR and CBR were higher in the nimotuzumab group, al-\nthough the difference was not statistically signi ﬁcant. These\nresults indicate that nimotuzumab may improve diseasecontrol and slow the progression of advanced PC.\nIn the subgroup analyses, the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine\ncombination showed a greater bene ﬁt, which was consis-\ntent with the results of the total population analysis. Thesubgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution be-cause after adjusting the sample size, the subgroups weresmall. Regarding the safety pro ﬁle, AEs or ADRs were\ncomparable between the two groups and did not increaseafter the addition of nimotuzumab.

This trial con ﬁrmed that nimotuzumab has a good\nsafety pro ﬁle.\nThe proportion of K-Ras wild-type tumors in our study was\n17.1%. This percentage was higher than the internationallyreported data, but similar to a previous nationwide study in\nChina (16.8%).\n20\nOne limitation of this study is that EGFR expression and other\ngenetic mutation types were not evaluated. It is unknownwhether patients with activation of the mitogen-activated\nprotein kinase pathway because of BRAF mutations would\nbeneﬁt from nimotuzumab treatment. Alternatively, other\nkinase fusion genes might confer sensitivity to nimotuzumab.Delineating the molecular subtypes of K-Ras wild-type tu-\nmors could improve patient selection for nimotuzumab\ntreatment.\nInformation on subsequent treatments after disease pro-\ngression was not collected, whi ch is another limitation of\nthis study. Third, although there were no statistically\nsigniﬁcant differences in baseline c haracteristi cs between\nthe two arms, nimotuzumab-tre ated patients were slightly\nyounger and had a better performance status. These fea-\ntures may have led to the improved treatment compliance.\nFinally, the study protocol was formulated in 2014,\nwhen the standard of care of ﬁrst-line treatment regimens\nin China was gemcitabine monotherapy.

Its incidence was high in the Asian population, especially in certain parts such as Southern China\nand South East Asia. Most patients with NPC are presented with intermediate-stage or locally advanced\ndisease requiring chemoradiation as the primary treatment of choice. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor\n(EGFR) was found overexpressed in most patients with NPC associated with poor prognosis making its\ninhibitor one of the most plausible treatment options in addition to chemoradiation. In EGFR-positive NPC\npatients, nimotuzumab, a humanized anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody will bind the extracellular domain of\nEGFR leading to tumor growth suppressions. This study’s objective was to assess the real-world clinical\nefficacy of nimotuzumab for patients with intermediate-stage and locally advanced NPC when in\ncombination with concurrent chemoradiation.\nMethods: This retrospective real-world study examined a sample of intermediate-stage and locally advanced\nNPC patients who were treated with or without adding nimotuzumab to concurrent chemoradiation at Dr.\nCipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital in Indonesia from January 2009 to December 2017. The outcomes\nwere patients’ real-world five-year overall survival (rwOS) and progression-free survival (rwPFS) compared\nusing Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities,\nclinical staging, staging based on Tumor status (T), staging based on Nodes status (N), and types of\nradiotherapy. \nResults: A total of 407 patients were included in the analysis, 61 patients receiving concurrent nimotuzumab\nand chemoradiation and 346 patients receiving chemoradiation alone. Patients receiving concurrent\nnimotuzumab and chemoradiation tended to have less aggressive NPC than patients receiving\nchemoradiation alone. Multivariate-adjusted Cox models revealed that combining nimotuzumab with\nchemoradiation was associated with a statistically significant longer rwOS gain (hazard ratio (HR)=0.46 (95%\nCI: 0.26-0.82, p=0.008)) and a trend of longer rwPFS (hazard ratio (HR)=0.67 (95% CI: 0.41-1.09, p=0.109)) in\ncomparison to chemoradiation alone. \nConclusion: In this retrospective real-world study, concurrent nimotuzumab and chemoradiation usage was\nassociated with a significant overall survival benefit than chemoradiation alone for intermediate-stage and\nlocally advanced NPC patients. Hence, adding nimotuzumab to patients’ chemoradiation should be\nconsidered in patients with intermediate-stage and locally advanced NPC.\nCategories:\n Internal Medicine, Otolaryngology, Radiation Oncology\nKeywords:\n survival, prognosis, chemoradiation, anti-egfr, egfr, nimotuzumab, nasopharyngeal carcinoma\nIntroduction\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma is one of the most common types of cancer in the head and neck region, with a\nunique geographical distribution \n[1]\n. It is most prevalent in the Asian population. Indonesia has become the\nsecond country with the highest incidence after China, with an incidence rate of 5,7 per 100.000 cases in\nmen and 1,9 per 100.000 cases in women. This number is much higher than the global incidence rate given\nthat the cancer cases in Indonesia are not well-documented, indicating a possible higher number in reality\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5,\n6\n \nOpen Access Original\nArticle\n \nDOI:\n 10.7759/cureus.48804\nHow to cite this article\nRachman A, Sari S, Munandar A, et al.

Cureus 15(11):\ne48804. \nDOI 10.7759/cureus.48804\n[2]\n.\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma is stratified into several stages according to the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM)\nclassification system. The treatment approach was based on what stages patients presented when admitted.\nCurrently, there are various treatment modalities for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, such as radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, targeted therapy, or surgery, with the former being more commonly used than the latter \n[3]\n.\nEven though nasopharyngeal carcinoma is radiosensitive, most patients who presented with locally\nadvanced disease required additional chemotherapy in their treatment regimens \n[4-6]\n. The combination of\nradiotherapy and chemotherapy has improved the overall survival in patients with nasopharyngeal\ncarcinoma. However, about 25% of patients were facing a treatment failure, thus an alternate treatment\nmodality has to be considered in addition to chemoradiation \n[7]\n. This is becoming more important\nconsidering the adverse events that patients experience after chemoradiation \n[8]\n. One to be acknowledged is\na targeted therapy in which an antibody acts toward a specific protein involved in tumorigenesis. Examples\nof targeted therapy are antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor (VEGF) \n[9]\n.\nThe overexpression of EGFR in nasopharyngeal tumor cells enables its function as a treatment modality a\nlegitimate option for patients with intermediate-stage and locally advanced disease \n[9]\n. Nimotuzumab, as\none of the monoclonal antibodies against EGFR, has been found to have an effect on reducing tumor\nvolumes despite its role in increasing overall survival in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal\ncarcinoma (NPC) while in combination with other treatment regimens is still debatable. Previously, a phase\nIII randomized clinical trial by Kong et al., involving 135 NPC patients, revealed that concurrent\nnimotuzumab with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) following TPF-based induction\nchemotherapy in comparison with concurrent chemoradiation with Cisplatin had a similar effect with lower\ntoxicities \n[10]\n. Hence, this observational study was conducted to evaluate the real-world data of adding\nnimotuzumab to other treatment regimens and its effect on patients with intermediate-stage and locally\nadvanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma in clinical practice.\nThis article’s abstract will be presented as a poster display at ESMO Asia Congress 2023 on December 1-3,\n2023.\nMaterials And Methods\nData source\nThis study was approved by the Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia’s ethical committee with\napproval number KET-456/UN2.F1/ETIK/PPM.00.02/2023. The data used in this study were obtained from\nelectronic and printed medical records at the Department of Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT), the Department of\nRadiation Oncology, and the Department of Internal Medicine, Dr. Cipto Manungkusumo General Hospital.\nData regarding patients’ status not documented in the medical record was extracted from the civil registry.\nPatient selection\nA total of 439 patients admitted with nasopharyngeal carcinoma from January 2009 to December 2017 were\nevaluated retrospectively. The inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma\nfrom all age groups who were either receiving nimotuzumab or chemoradiation. Patients with stage I\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma, metastatic disease, and patients with unknown staging were excluded from the\nstudy. Data extraction was conducted from March 9, 2023, to March 31, 2023. From the data collected, 84 out\nof 439 patients were receiving nimotuzumab. The remaining 355 patients were treated with chemoradiation,\nwhich was the control of this study. All the data taken were then tabulated in a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft\nCorporation, Redmond, WA) table.\nStudy endpoint\nThe primary outcome assessed in this study was five-year real-world overall survival (rwOS) in patients\nreceiving nimotuzumab or control. Another outcome, such as five-year real-world progression-free survival\n(rwPFS) was assessed. Five-year rwOS was defined as patients’ survival from any cause of death in five years\nafter the initiation of patients’ therapy. Meanwhile, five-year rwPFS was defined as patients’ survival from\ntheir disease progression which includes tumor growth and spread. Patients’ progression was determined\nfrom the follow-up radiological examination results taken from patients' medical records. The start index\ndate was the first day that patients received treatment: either nimotuzumab or chemotherapy. Patients\nwithout recorded death or loss of follow-up were censored.\nData analysis\nThis study performed the analysis using SPSS version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The primary outcome of\nthis study was presented as Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the Cox proportional hazard analysis. Other\nvariables regarding baseline characteristics between the two groups were evaluated using crosstabs,\nfollowed by chi-square tests for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank sums test for continuous\nvariables. The effect of different treatment care for patients on rwOS and rwPFS was tested using the\n2023 Rachman et al. Cureus 15(11): e48804. DOI 10.7759/cureus.48804\n2\n of \n10\nmultivariate analysis with adjustment for gender, age, comorbidities, clinical staging, staging based on\nTumor status (T), staging based on Nodes status (N), and types of radiotherapy.\nResults\nPatients’ socio-demography\nAmong the 439 screened patients, 2 patients were receiving nimotuzumab with a diagnosis of stage I\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma and 2 patients had metastatic disease; thus they were excluded. A total of 11\npatients, 9 patients receiving nimotuzumab and 2 receiving control, were also excluded due to unknown\nstaging based on their medical records. Patients with unknown records of radiotherapy modalities were\nexcluded, 10 patients from the nimotuzumab receiving group and 7 patients from the control group.\nTherefore, the remaining 407 patients were eligible for further analysis. \nThe radiotherapy (RT) regimens recorded were 2-dimensional RT, 3-dimensional conformal RT, and\nintensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The RT doses were equivalent to 70 Gy for gross tumor and\nnodes, 60 Gy for high-risk areas, and 50 Gy for elective nodes. The chemotherapy regimens included were\ncisplatin, 5FU, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and capecitabine. The dose of nimotuzumab in the interventional\ngroup was 200 mg weekly.\nIn this study, it was revealed that the proportion of sex distribution was equal in both the nimotuzumab-\nreceiving group and the control group (p = 0.162). The age of patients was also similar in both groups (p =\n0.276). Even though both groups, the majority of patients were classified as WHO type 3 by histopathologic\nfindings, with 73.8% in patients receiving nimotuzumab and 87.6% in patients receiving the control, the\ndistribution was significantly uneven (p = 0.00).\nIn both groups, most patients were diagnosed in the late stage (clinical stage IVA) even though the\ndifference was enormous (45.9% vs 81.8%, p = 0.00). Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes\nmellitus, renal disease, and liver disease were found more in patients who didn’t receive nimotuzumab\n(44.2% vs 14.1%, p = 0.00). Adjusted comparisons between a combination with nimotuzumab and\nchemoradiation alone were conducted using multivariate Cox models, controlling for patient baseline\ncharacteristics, including age, gender, comorbidities, clinical staging, staging based on Tumor status (T),\nstaging based on Node status (N), and types of radiotherapy.

The mean\nsurvival in all of the patients was estimated as 8.4 years. The mean survival time in patients receiving\nnimotuzumab was estimated as 11.12 (95% CI: 9.731-12.509) years while the other group was estimated as\n6.23 (95% CI: 5.748-6.716) years.\nFIGURE\n 1: Kaplan-Meier survival curves for five-year rwOS\nrwOS: real-world overall survival\nPatients’ rwPFS was also analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Figure \n2\n). About 60.7% of patients\nin the nimotuzumab-receiving group survived the five-year disease progression while in the control group,\nabout 42.2% of patients survived. The unadjusted result was significantly different (p = 0.02). The mean\nprogression-free survival in the nimotuzumab-receiving group was 9.181 (95% CI: 7.612-10.750) years while\nin control was 5.425 (95% CI: 4.946-5.904) years.\n2023 Rachman et al.

Previous studies have shown that nimotuzumab improved patients’ overall\n2023 Rachman et al. Cureus 15(11): e48804. DOI 10.7759/cureus.48804\n7\n of \n10\nremission rate and overall survival when in combination with chemoradiation. A meta-analysis conducted\nby Yuan et al. revealed that a combination of nimotuzumab and RT/chemoradiation had a better overall\nremission rate (ORR) of the primary tumor than a combination of cetuximab with RT/chemoradiation (ORR =\n3.21 (95% CI: 1.97-5.21)) or RT/chemoradiation alone (ORR = 4.11 (95% CI: 2.43-6.94)). Their results also\nshowed that nimotuzumab had a trend of longer three-year OS than a combination of cetuximab with\nRT/chemoradiation (OS rate = 4.22 (95% CI: 1.61-11.05)) or RT/chemoradiation alone (OS rate = 2.05 (95% CI:\n0.62-6.76)) \n[11]\n. A study by Liu et al. evaluating nimotuzumab's efficacy in combination with chemoradiation\nin 42 NPC patients reported that the ORR was 100% and the two-year OS was 96.6% \n[12]\n. Another study\nconducted by Fangzheng et al. revealed a satisfactory result with a three-year OS of 86.8% \n[13]\n. Whilst the\nORR was not analyzed, our study affirmed that patients receiving nimotuzumab in their chemoradiation had\nbetter OS than patients receiving chemoradiation alone gained (hazard ratio (HR)=0.46 (95% CI: 0.26-0.82,\np=0.008)). In comparison with the study by Liu et al. and Wang et al., we reported lower OS (73.8%) but with\na longer period of follow-up time and a larger amount of patients. Consistent results of better OS in patients\nreceiving nimotuzumab were hypothetically related to its mechanism in which nimotuzumab will enhance\nCisplatin's effect by involving the EGFR/AKT activation. Thus, adding nimotuzumab to chemoradiation\ncould benefit patients with NPC by increasing the apoptotic effect of chemotherapy \n[14]\n.\nIn spite of a better five-year rwOS in patients receiving nimotuzumab, the five-year rwPFS was not\nsignificantly different even though the trend was better in the nimotuzumab-receiving group (HR=0.67 (95%\nCI: 0.41-1.09, p=0.109)). Regardless of the non-significant rwPFS, our result showed that adding\nnimotuzumab to patients' chemoradiation improved patients' rwPFS by 18.5%. Our study was in accordance\nwith a larger propensity score-matched analysis by Zhi-Qiang et al., which revealed a slightly better five-\nyear PFS in the nimotuzumab receiving group (79.96% vs 77.99%, p=0.117) involving 730 patients with NPC\n[15]\n. A phase II clinical trial by Huang et al. reported a better PFS of 83.5% \n[16]\n. Another propensity score-\nmatched analysis conducted by Yao et al. showed that the five-year PFS was significantly better in patients\nreceiving nimotuzumab than patients receiving chemoradiation alone even after adjustment (aHR=0.38 (95%\nCI, 0.11-0.89, p=0.041)) \n[17]\n. In comparison with the study by Huang et al. and the study by Yao et al., our\nstudy involved a larger amount of patients and a longer period of follow-up time. An essential point to take\nnote of was that the disease progression was evaluated with a radiological examination, either a follow-up\nCT scan or MRI after a month, two months, and three months while the gold standard was a follow-up\nnasopharyngeal MRI test after 12 weeks. With various modalities in evaluating patients' progression, the\nfive-year rwPFS should be interpreted carefully.\nAside from its benefit for patients' survival, our study revealed that patients receiving nimotuzumab had\nfewer toxicities. Some of the minimal adverse reactions reported were mucositis,\nhyperpigmentation, xerostomia, and nausea experienced by 32.8% of patients receiving nimotuzumab and\nwere considered tolerable. This result was consistent with a study by Chen et al. who used cetuximab and\nnimotuzumab in combination with radiotherapy for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients\nshowed that patients receiving cetuximab in their care had a higher incidence of mucositis than patients\ntreated with nimotuzumab (87% vs 15%) \n[18]\n. The mechanism was postulated in a study by Takeda et al.,\nstating that nimotuzumab had a different binding manner than other antibodies against EGFR. Dissimilar to\ncetuximab, which binds to cells with lower EGFR expression levels in a monovalent manner, nimotuzumab\nrequires a divalent binding \n[19]\n. As a consequence, in cells with lower EGFR expression levels, such as skin,\nnimotuzumab will cause fewer adverse reactions.\nMost of the proposed confounding factors, such as gender, clinical stage, staging based on Tumor status (T),\ncomorbidities, and types of radiotherapy, had no significant effect on the five-year rwOS and rwPFS.\nMeanwhile, the result showed that older age slightly affected patients' five-year rwOS (aHR=1.015 (95% CI:\n1.002-1.028, p=0.02)) and a non-significant effect in five-year rwPFS (aHR=1.008 (95% CI: 0.996-1.020,\np=0.197)). Similarly, staging based on Nodes status (N), especially patients with N3, affected patients' five-\nyear rwOS significantly (aHR=2.414 (95% CI: 1.241-4.699, p=0.009)) and a trend of worse rwPFS (aHR=1.473\n(95% CI: 0.841-2.580, p=0.175). We omitted histological results based on WHO types from the Cox\nproportional hazard model due to its unrecorded data in some patients (N/A category). According to a study\nby Siti-Azrin et al., the WHO classification type did not significantly affect patients' prognosis \n[20]\n.\nTherefore, excluding the aforementioned variable should not interfere with our results.\nLimitation\nThis study was conducted retrospectively, which could lead to sample size and selection bias. Being\nretrospective, it is inherently limited by the accuracy of historical medical records and potential confounders\nnot accounted for in the analysis. Another essential fact concerning the unequal number of patients between\nthe two groups should be taken into consideration while interpreting our results. In our study, data\nregarding patients' EBV DNA levels, which can affect patients' prognosis, was not evaluated. Lastly, this\nstudy did not compare nimotuzumab with other EGFR inhibitors directly, which could have provided clearer\npictures of its relative efficacy.\nConclusions\nIn summary, despite the above-mentioned limitations, this study provides a reference value in regard to\n2023 Rachman et al. Cureus 15(11): e48804. DOI 10.7759/cureus.48804\n8\n of \n10\nnimotuzumab utilization for patients with intermediate-stage and locally advanced NPC. In this\nretrospective, real-world study of intermediate-stage and locally advanced NPC patients, concurrent\nnimotuzumab and chemoradiation usage was associated with a significant overall survival benefit than\nchemoradiation alone. Hence, the combination of nimotuzumab and chemoradiation should be considered\nin patients with intermediate-stage and locally advanced NPC.\nWe recommend the conduction of larger, prospective, multi-center trials with balanced patients between the\ninterventional and control groups in the future.\nAdditional Information\nAuthor Contributions\nAll authors have reviewed the final version to be published and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the\nwork.\nConcept and design:\n  \nAndhika Rachman, Arie Munandar, Marlinda Adham, Susanna H.

  "New Microsoft Word Document.docx": "### Project Overview: AI-Agentic Pharma Sales Platform\n\n\n\nBased on your description, I'll outline a phased approach to building an AI-agentic project for selling pharmaceutical products. The core idea is to start with a messaging-based product knowledge assistant (Phase 1) and evolve it into a data-driven, predictive smart sales platform (Phase 2). This leverages AI for interactive support, ensuring sales teams can access accurate product info on-the-fly while complying with pharma regulations (e.g., avoiding unsubstantiated claims or off-label promotion—always consult legal experts).\n\n\n\nI'll assume the pharma products are legal, over-the-counter or prescription items sold through ethical channels. The system will use a messaging platform for real-time Q&A, linked to a centralized product knowledge base (e.g., a database of drug info, dosages, side effects, and sales scripts).\n\n\n\n#### Key Assumptions and Considerations\n\n- **Target Users**: Sales reps interacting via messaging to query product details during customer engagements.\n\n- **Tech Stack**: Open-source or affordable tools to keep it scalable. Use LLMs like Grok (from xAI) for natural language processing.\n\n- **Compliance**: Pharma sales involve strict rules (e.g., FDA/EMA guidelines). The AI must cite sources from approved knowledge bases and log interactions for audits.\n\n- **Security**: Handle sensitive data (e.g., customer queries) with encryption; use HIPAA-compliant tools if dealing with health info.\n\n- **Platforms**: WhatsApp (via Business API for broad reach), Telegram (easy bot setup), or a dedicated app (e.g., built with Twilio or custom web app for full control).\n\n\n\n#### Phase 1: Messaging-Based Product Knowledge Assistant\n\nThis phase focuses on a simple, interactive AI agent that acts as a \"knowledge source\" for sales reps. They can ask questions about products they're selling, and the AI responds with linked info from a curated database.\n\n\n\n**Objectives**:\n\n- Enable quick Q&A for sales reps (e.g., \"What's the dosage for Product X?\").\n\n- Link responses to official product knowledge (e.g., PDFs, databases).\n\n- Prototype quickly for testing.\n\n\n\n**Implementation Steps**:\n\n1. **Choose and Set Up Messaging Platform**:\n\n   - **WhatsApp**: Use WhatsApp Business API. Integrate with a backend (e.g., via Meta's developer tools). Pros: High user adoption in many regions. Cons: Approval process for API access.\n\n   - **Telegram**: Build a bot using Telegram Bot API. Pros: Free, easy to deploy with Python libraries like `python-telegram-bot`. Cons: Less professional for B2B.\n\n   - **Dedicated**: Use Twilio or Dialogflow for a custom messaging interface. Pros: Full customization, integrate with CRM. Cons: Higher setup cost.\n\n   - Recommendation: Start with Telegram for rapid prototyping, then migrate to WhatsApp for scale.\n\n\n\n2. **Build the AI Agent**:\n\n   - **Core AI**: Use an LLM (e.g., Grok API) to process natural language queries. Feed it a product knowledge base (e.g., a vector database like Pinecone or FAISS storing pharma docs).\n\n   - **Knowledge Base**: Create a structured database:\n\n     - Sources: Product inserts, clinical studies, sales guides (upload as PDFs or text).\n\n     - Tools: Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to fetch relevant info—e.g., query \"side effects of Aspirin\" retrieves exact matches.\n\n   - **Interaction Flow**:\n\n     - Sales rep messages: \"Tell me about Product Y's interactions.\"\n\n     - AI responds: \"Product Y interacts with [list]. Source: [link to knowledge base].\"\n\n     - Add buttons for quick actions (e.g., \"Share brochure\" sends a PDF link).\n\n\n\n3. **Technical Setup**:\n\n   - **Backend**: Python with Flask/Django for handling messages. Integrate LLM via xAI API.\n\n   - **Deployment**: Host on AWS/Heroku. Use webhooks for real-time messaging.\n\n   - **Testing**: Simulate sales scenarios; ensure responses are accurate and fast (<5s).\n\n   - **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for MVP (Minimum Viable Product).\n\n\n\n**Potential Challenges**:\n\n- Handling ambiguous queries (e.g., train AI with pharma-specific prompts).\n\n- Multi-language support (e.g., English + Indonesian).\n\n- Rate limits on messaging APIs.\n\n\n\n**Success Metrics**: 80% query resolution accuracy, 50% reduction in sales reps' research time.\n\n\n\n#### Phase 2: Data-Driven Smart Sales Platform with Predictions\n\nBuild on Phase 1 by adding analytics, data collection, and predictive AI to make it a \"smart\" platform. This turns interactions into insights for better sales strategies.\n\n\n\n**Objectives**:\n\n- Collect data from Q&A sessions to predict trends (e.g., popular products, customer pain points).\n\n- Provide proactive recommendations (e.g., \"Based on recent queries, suggest upselling Product Z\").\n\n- Evolve into a full sales tool with dashboards and automation.\n\n\n\n**Implementation Steps**:\n\n1. **Data Collection and Integration**:\n\n   - Log all interactions (anonymized): Queries, responses, user feedback.\n\n   - Integrate with CRM (e.g., Salesforce or HubSpot) to link sales data (e.g., deals closed post-query).\n\n   - Tools: Use MongoDB/PostgreSQL for storage; ELK Stack (Elasticsearch) for search/analytics.\n\n\n\n2. **Add Predictive Features**:\n\n   - **Data Analytics**: Use pandas/NumPy for processing logs. Visualize trends with Tableau or Matplotlib (e.g., \"Top queried products this month\").\n\n   - **ML Predictions**:\n\n     - Models: Train with scikit-learn or PyTorch for tasks like:\n\n       - Customer intent prediction (e.g., classify queries as \"interest in buying\" vs. \"info only\").\n\n       - Sales forecasting (e.g., predict demand based on query volume).\n\n       - Recommendation engine (e.g., \"Users asking about pain relief often buy Product A—suggest it\").\n\n     - Data Sources: Interaction logs + external (e.g., market trends via APIs, but avoid real-time web scraping).\n\n   - **AI Enhancements**: Upgrade to agentic AI (e.g., multi-step reasoning: \"Query → Analyze data → Predict outcome → Respond\").\n\n\n\n3. **Platform Evolution**:\n\n   - **Dashboard**: Web app (React/Node.js) for sales managers to view insights (e.g., \"Prediction: 20% increase in Product X sales next quarter\").\n\n   - **Automation**: AI auto-suggests responses or escalates complex queries to humans.\n\n   - **Scalability**: Add multi-user support, role-based access (e.g., reps vs. admins).\n\n   - **Timeline**: 8-12 weeks post-Phase 1, including data training.\n\n\n\n**Potential Challenges**:\n\n- Data privacy (GDPR/HIPAA compliance).\n\n- Model accuracy (start with supervised learning on labeled data).\n\n- Integration complexity (e.g., syncing with existing pharma systems).\n\n\n\n**Success Metrics**: 70% prediction accuracy, 30% sales uplift from recommendations, user adoption rate >90%.\n\n\n\n#### Overall Roadmap and Costs\n\n- **Total Timeline**: 3-6 months for both phases.\n\n- **Budget Estimate**: $10K-50K (development, APIs, hosting). Use open-source to minimize.\n\n- **Next Steps**: \n\n  1. Define specific pharma products and regulations.\n\n  2. Prototype Phase 1 bot (I can help generate sample code if needed).\n\n  3. Gather feedback and iterate.\n\n\n\nThis setup creates a scalable, AI-powered tool that boosts sales efficiency. If you provide more details (e.g., specific platforms or products), I can refine this further!",

Nimotuzumab is an EGFR monoclonal antibody thought to play a significant role in the treatment of GBM. This paper presents \na retrospective cohort study that evaluates the clinical efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab in GBM.\nMaterials and Methods:  A total of 56 newly diagnosed patients with EGFR-positive GBM were included in our study. The patients were divided \ninto radiotherapy (RT) + temozolomide (TMZ) + nimotuzumab (39 patients) and RT + TMZ (17 patients) groups based on whether or not nimotu -\nzumab was added during RT . Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicities were assessed.\nResults:  The median follow-up time was 27 .9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.1-30.8). The median PFS was 12.4 months (95% CI, \n7 .8-17 .0) and 8.2 months (95% CI, 6.1-10.3) in the 2 groups, respectively, P = .052. The median OS was 27 .3 months (95% CI, 19.0-35.6) and 16.7 \nmonths (95% CI, 11 .1-22.2), respectively, P = .018. In patients with unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter, \nthe PFS and OS were significantly better in patients treated with nimotuzumab than in those without nimotuzumab (median PFS: 19.3 vs 6.7 \nmonths, P = .001; median OS: 20.2 vs 13.8 months, P = .026). During the treatment period, no statistically significant difference in toxicity was \nnoted between the 2 groups.\nConclusion:  Our retrospective cohort study suggests the efficacy of Nimotuzumab combined with concurrent RT with TMZ in patients with \nnewly diagnosed EGFR-positive GBM, and specifically those with unmethylated MGMT promoter. Further prospective studies are warranted to \nvalidate our findings. Besides, nimotuzumab demonstrated good safety and tolerability.\nKey words:  glioblastoma; epidermal growth factor receptor; nimotuzumab; temozolomide; radiotherapy; survival.\nImplications for Practice\nThis study recruited treatment-naïve patients with glioblastoma (GBM) with positive EGFR expression. Of note, this is arguably the first \ncase-control study in China that targeted patients with EGFR-positive GBM. It was found that nimotuzumab combined with concurrent \nradiotherapy with temozolomide demonstrated efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed EGFR-positive GBM. The progression-\nfree survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients in the group that used nimotuzumab were superior to those that did not use \nnimotuzumab. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of nimotuzumab is an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS in patients \nwith EGFR-positive GBM. Further analysis showed that nimotuzumab could further improve the survival rate of patients with unmethylated \nO6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter. Nimotuzumab demonstrated good safety and tolerability. This may provide \na clinical reference for the treatment of GBM.\nIntroduction\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent primary brain \ntumor in adults, accounting for approximately 60%-70% \nof gliomas.1 It is poorly differentiated, aggressive, highly malignant, and has a poor prognosis.2,3 At present, its stan -\ndard treatment includes the maximum extent resection under \nthe premise of ensuring safety, concurrent chemoradio -\ntherapy (CCRT) with temozolomide (TMZ), and adjuvant \nReceived: 16 April 2022; Accepted: 8 September 2022.\n© The Author(s) 2022.

Nonetheless, these therapeu -\ntic approaches only prolong progression-free survival (PFS) \nto 6.9 months and overall survival (OS) to 14.6 months. \nEven with regular treatment, GBM with unmethylated \nO6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) pro -\nmoter has a worse prognosis, with a PFS of only 5.3 months \nand an OS of only 12.7 months.4 To enhance the survival of \nGBM, clinical studies of CCRT with TMZ combined with \ntargeted therapy, immunotherapy, or other chemotherapeutic \ndrugs have been actively implemented in China and abroad \nwith most still in phase I and II research stages, and few stud -\nies demonstrated the positive results.5-7 As such, it is necessary \nto identify novel treatments to further improve the outcome.\nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed \nto varying degrees in more than 40% of gliomas. Activation \nof the EGFR pathway is linked to tumor angiogenesis, tumor \ninvasion, and metastasis, as well as resistance to chemora -\ndiotherapy.8,9 Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal \nantibody against EGFR that specifically binds to EGFR, hin -\nders EGFR binding to its ligand, and finally impedes EGFR-\nmediated downstream signaling as well as suppresses tumor \ngrowth. Secondly, nimotuzumab mediates immune effects, \nincluding antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity \n(ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) that \ndirectly kill tumor cells. Furthermore, it forms a complex after \nbinding to EGFR; this complex then enters the cell through \nendocytosis and is degraded to achieve the anti-tumor effect. \nRadioimmunoassay has proven that nimotuzumab would \ncross the blood-brain barrier.10 Besides, it could improve the \nsensitivity of TMZ and radiotherapy (RT).11,12 Therefore, \nscholars believe that nimotuzumab could improve OS in pri -\nmary GBM theoretically. However, in clinical practice, there \nis little consensus on whether nimotuzumab improves the \nprognosis of primary GBM. A single-arm study in Shanghai \nHuashan Hospital enrolled 26 patients with GBM. All \npatients were subjected to CCRT and nimotuzumab. The PFS \nand OS were 10.0 and 15.9 months, respectively. Analysis \nshowed that the PFS and OS were not correlated with EGFR \nexpression. Nevertheless, the 12-month OS rate was better in \nEGFR-negative patients than that in EGFR-positive patients \n(90% vs. 53.8%, P = .07).13 A German-based randomized \ncontrolled study revealed that the OS and PFS of patients in \nthe nimotuzumab + CCRT group were superior to those of \npatients in the CCRT group. However, there was no statisti -\ncally significant difference (22.3 vs. 19.6 months, P = .4856; \n7.7 vs. 5.8 months P = .7898). Further analysis showed that \nthe PFS and OS of patients with EGFR amplification treated \nwith nimotuzumab are superior to those of patients with -\nout EGFR amplification (8.9 vs. 8.2 months, 21.2 vs. 17.2 \nmonths); besides, the 12-month PFS rate between the 2 groups \nwas similar in patients without EGFR amplification.14 A sin -\ngle-arm multicenter study in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer \nCenter enrolled 36 patients with positive EGFR expression, \nand as a result, the PFS was 11.9 months and the OS was \n24.5 months following the combined treatment with nimo -\ntuzumab. These findings are encouraging, however, the study \nhad no control group and was a single-arm study.15 Taken \ntogether, nimotuzumab maybe exerts more benefit to patients \nwith EGFR-positive GBM. Moreover, in head and neck squa -\nmous cell carcinomas, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, \nEGFR positivity is a biomarker for nimotuzumab. GBM \npatients with EGFR amplification had a poorer prognosis.16-18 \nWhether nimotuzumab improves survival in patients with EGFR-positive GBM remains unclear. The clinical efficacy and \nsafety of nimotuzumab combined with concurrent irradiation \nand TMZ in newly diagnosed patients with EGFR-positive \nGBM were evaluated in this single-center retrospective cohort \nstudy from China; the study matched other known factors \nthat may affect the prognosis of GBM.\nPatients and Methods\nPatient Characteristics\nData of 56 patients were retrospectively analyzed between \nMarch 2018 and November 2020 at the Xiangya Hospital of \nCentral South University. The main inclusion criteria included: \n(1) newly diagnosed patients; (2) histological diagnosis of \nGBM; (3) immunohistochemical EGFR positive (more than \n10% of tumor cells stained brownish-yellow were considered \npositive for EGFR expression.); (4) aged 18-70 years; (5) KPS \nscore ≥60; (6) good blood routine, liver and kidney function; \n(7) all patients experienced surgery and CCRT; and (8) com -\nplete follow-up data. On the other hand, the exclusion criteria \nincluded: (1) EGFR negative; (2) previous craniocerebral RT; \n(3) combined with other malignant tumors or serious dis -\neases; (4) missing reexamination data or follow-up data; and \n(5) patients could not tolerate combined therapy or refuse. \nBased on different treatment strategy patients were divided \ninto RT + TMZ + nimotuzumab or RT + TMZ groups and \nmatched the baseline data.\nTreatment Methods\nSurgical Stage\nSurgical stage involves the removal of the tumor to the great -\nest extent under the premise of ensuring safety. Patients in \nboth groups underwent tumor resection surgery. Based on the \ndegree of surgical resection, surgery was divided into gross \ntotal resection (GTR) (degree of resection 100%) and subto -\ntal resection (STR) (degree of resection 80%-90%).\nCCRT Stage\nIn CCRT stage, patients in both groups received intensi -\nty-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). On CT localization \nimages, we determined and delineated the tumor target area \n(total tumor volume (GTV), clinical tumor volume (CTV), \nand planned tumor volume (PTV) as well as vital tissues and \nnormal organs that need protection using preoperative and \npostoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as \nsurgical records and surgeon suggestions according to the \nEORTC target delineation principle. Oncologists and radiolo -\ngists identified residual GTV and tumor bed (GTVtb) as GTV \nunder joint reading. The CTV was a margin of 2 cm from \nthe GTV. The PTV was placed an additional 0.3 cm around \nthe CTV. RT was 2.0 Gy/day, 5 days a week for 60 Gy for 6 \nweeks. Starting on the first day of RT, a dose of 75 mg/m2/\nday of TMZ capsules was orally administered until the end of \nRT. Patients in the RT + TMZ + nimotuzumab arm received \nnimotuzumab weekly for 6 doses during RT. Nimotuzumab \nInjection 200 mg was diluted in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chlo -\nride solution, IVGTT, over 60 minutes.\nAC Phase\nIn AC phase, TMZ regimen was administered 4 weeks of rest \nafter RT. The dose of the first cycle was 150 mg/m2/day for 5 \nconsecutive days, with 23 days of rest, ie, 28 days as a course Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/advance-article/doi/10.1093/oncolo/oyac202/6743293 by guest on 24 October 2022\n\nThe Oncologist , 2022, Vol. XX, No. XX 3\nof treatment. In the absence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or \nthrombocytopenia in the first cycle, the dose was 200 mg/m2/\nday for 5 days with 23 days of rest, ie, 28 days as a course of \ntreatment from the second cycle. There were 6 cycles of AC if \nno progression occurred.\nEfficacy and Toxicities\nMRI re-examinations were performed at an interval of every \n2-3 months after CCRT until disease progression or death. \nEfficacy was assessed based on RANO criteria, which were \ndivided into complete response (CR), partial response (PR), \nstable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD). For the dif -\nferential diagnosis of tumor recurrence, particularly for the \npresence of new lesions in the radiation field within 3 months \nafter CCRT, the following factors were integrated for com -\nprehensive determination: the extent of surgical resection, \nmolecular pathology, time to recurrence, clinical symptoms, \ndynamic MRI T1-enhanced image changes, MRS, and PWI. If \nnecessary, multidisciplinary discussion was held. Patients were \nevaluated for toxicity based on the Common Terminology \nCriteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 5.0).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe primary study endpoints were PFS and OS. PFS was \ndefined as the time interval from diagnosis (date of surgery) \nto determination of tumor recurrence. OS was defined as the \ntime interval from the start of diagnosis to death. The base -\nline data and adverse reaction data of patients were analyzed \nthrough the direct counting method; the measurement data \nwere expressed by a median, and the χ2 test was used for com -\nparison. GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, \nCA, USA) and SPSS 23.0 statistical software were used for \nall statistical analyses. OS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier \nsurvival curves, and the difference in survival between the 2 groups was analyzed using the log-rank test; P < .05 was \nconsidered statistically significant. Cox proportional hazards \nmodel was used for multivariate analysis influencing PFS and \nOS.\nResults\nPatient Characteristics\nA total of 56 newly diagnosed GBM patients in our hospi -\ntal were enrolled between March 2018 and November 2020. \nEGFR immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining on \nthe cell membrane of slices in all patients. In total, 39 patients \nwere in the RT + TMZ + nimotuzumab group, including \n28 males and 11 females with an average age of 52 years \n(range 22-69 years). KPS at treatment initiation was 70 (range \n70-80). GTR was performed in 34 patients, STR in 5 patients, \nIDH wild-type in 38 patients, and IDH mutant in 1 patient; \n14 patients showed methylation of the MGMT promoter, \nwhereas 25 were unmethylated. Among the 17 patients in the \nRT + TMZ group, 12 were male and 5 were female with an \naverage age of 58 years (range 33-71 years). KPS at treatment \ninitiation was 70 (range 60-90). GTR was performed in 15 \npatients, STR in 2 patients, IDH wild-type in 16 patients, and \nIDH mutant in 1 patient; 4 patients showed MGMT promoter \nmethylation, whereas 13 were unmethylated. No significant \ndifferences were noted in gender, age, degree of surgical resec -\ntion, IDH status, or MGMT promoter status between the 2 \ngroups ( P > .05). Table 1  shows the comprehensive character -\nistics of GBM patients.\nEfficacy and Survival\nAs of 21 February 2022, the follow-up period was 27.9 \nmonths (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.1-30.8).

A \ntotal of 21 (53.8%) patients died. The estimated PFS rate \nwas 53.8% at first year, and 19.6% at second year. The esti -\nmated OS rate was 89.7% at the first year, and 54.1% at \nthe second year. For patients in the RT + TMZ group, the \nbest response as per the RANO assessment was complete \nresponse in 15 patients (88.2%), partial response in 1 patient \n(5.9%), and stable disease in 1 patient (5.9%). During fol -\nlow-up, 16 patients (94.1%) displayed progressive disease, \nincluding 10 in situ recurrences, 3 ectopic recurrences, and \n3 both in situ and ectopic recurrences; 13 (76.5%) patients \nsuccumbed. The estimated PFS rate was 23.5% at the first \nyear and 11.8% at the second year. The estimated OS rate \nwas 70.6% at the first year, and 20.2% at the second year. \nThe median PFS was 12.4 months (95% CI, 7.8-17.0) and \n8.2 months (95% CI, 6.1-10.3) in the 2 groups, respectively, \nP = .052. The median OS was 27.3 months (95% CI, 19.0-\n35.6) and 16.7 months (95% CI, 11.1-22.2) in the 2 groups, \nrespectively, P = .018 ( Figs. 1-2 ). Fig. 3  shows the MRI \nchanges in the patient.\nUnivariate analysis of known clinical prognostic factors \nshowed that patients with GTR of the tumor at the time of \nsurgery had a better PFS than those with STR ( P < .001). \nNotably, MGMT promoter methylation improved PFS and \nOS (P = .002; P = .028). In addition, the use of nimotuzumab \nimproved PFS and OS ( P = .052; P = .018). Multivariate anal -\nyses were performed for PFS and OS to adjust all factors listed in Table 2 . GTR was identified as an independent prognostic \nfactor for PFS ( P < .001). Also, MGMT promoters methyla -\ntion and the use of nimotuzumab were considered indepen -\ndent prognostic factors for PFS and OS ( P = .003, P = .016; \nP = .027, P = .008).\nAnalysis of MGMT promoter methylation status in the 2 \ngroups revealed that 14 patients in the nimotuzumab + and \nmethylated groups experienced a median PFS of 17.6 \nmonths (95% CI, 15.8-19.5) as well as a median OS of 28.9 \nmonths (95% CI, 26.7-31.1). The 25 patients in the nimotu -\nzumab + and unmethylated groups had a median PFS of 10.3 \nmonths (95% CI, 6.1-14.5) and a median OS of 21.3 months \n(95% CI, 17.9—24.7). The 4 patients in the nimotuzumab- \nand methylated groups had a median PFS of 19.3 months \n(95% CI, 8.5-30.1) and a median OS of 20.2 months. The \n13 patients in the nimotuzumab- and unmethylated groups \nhad a median PFS of 6.7 months (95% CI, 4.4-9.0) and a \nmedian OS of 13.8 months (95% CI, 10.2-17.5). In the group \nwithout nimotuzumab, patients with methylated MGMT \npromoter had significantly better PFS and OS than those \nwith unmethylated MGMT promoters ( P = .001; P = .026). \nNevertheless, in the group using nimotuzumab, no signifi -\ncant difference in PFS and OS was found between patients \nwith and without MGMT promoter methylation ( P = .077; \nP = .278). The comparison of patients with MGMT promoter \nmethylation showed no significant difference in PFS and OS \nbetween patients with and without nimotuzumab ( P = .772; \nP = .779). In patients with unmethylated MGMT promoter, \nPFS and OS were significantly better with nimotuzumab than \nin those without nimotuzumab ( P = .001; P = .001) ( Fig. 4 ).\nAdverse Events\nDuring the treatment period, no statistically significant \ndifference in toxicity was detected between the 2 groups. \nNimotuzumab combined with standard TMZ + RT was safe \nand well-tolerated by patients. No grade 3 or higher toxici -\nties were detected. Table 3  summarizes toxicity data for all \npatients. The most frequent toxicities during treatment were \nhematotoxicities, such as grades 1-2 neutropenia and grades \n1-2 thrombocytopenia. The remainder also had vomiting, \nconstipation, fatigue, dizziness, and increased liver trans -\naminase. After symptomatic treatment, the above toxicities \nwere improved. Four patients developed a rash, which was \nassociated with nimotuzumab. After the first treatment with \nnimotuzumab, the body temperature of one patient was 39.1 \n°C; this was considered an infusion reaction which was com -\npletely alleviated after symptomatic treatment.\nDiscussion\nPatients with GBM have a poor prognosis despite the success -\nful application of surgery and standard chemoradiotherapy.19 \nGene amplification and protein overexpression of EGFR has \nbeen detected in several GBM patients.20-22 Activation of EGFR \nsignaling causes uncontrolled tumor proliferation. However, \ntargeted therapy against EGFR amplification has emerged as \none of the therapeutic options for gliomas. Notably, nimo -\ntuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that detects \nthe extracellular domain of EGFR and competitively binds to \nEGFR, thereby inhibiting signaling pathways. Reports have \nshown that the distribution of nimotuzumab is tumor-spe -\ncific.23 Also, previous preclinical studies indicate that nimo -\ntuzumab improves radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity of \nFigure 1.

Of note, this is arguably the \nfirst cohort study in China that targets patients with EGFR-\npositive GBM. In total, we enrolled 56 patients for analysis. \nBy February 2022, the PFS and OS of patients in the group that used nimotuzumab were superior to those that did not \nuse nimotuzumab (12.4 vs. 8.2 months, P = .052; 27.3 vs. \n16.7 months, P = .018). Through multivariate analysis, we \nidentified that the use of nimotuzumab is an independent \nprognostic factor for PFS and OS in patients with EGFR-\npositive GBM ( P = .027 and .008, respectively). Notably, the \nprognosis of patients with EGFR-positive GBM treated with \nthe combination of nimotuzumab in our study exceeds that \nof all previous studies. A study by Du enrolled 36 patients \nwith EGFR-positive GBM. All patients received TMZ and \nnimotuzumab based on postoperative RT. Their PFS was 11.9 \nmonths (95% CI, 5.5-18.2) and OS was 24.5 months (95% \nFigure 2.

Because many studies have \nshown that GTR can improve GBM prognosis. According to \nWang et al, all GBM patients were treated with nimotuzumab, \nand in 50.0% (13/26) of EGFR-positive patients, PFS was 11 \nmonths and OS was only 13 months.13 Among them, the GTR \nrate was only 34.6%, and no pathological molecular markers \ninfluencing prognosis, including MGMT promoter methyla -\ntion status and IDH mutation status were mentioned in the \ntext. Westphal et al enrolled 20 patients with EGFR amplifi -\ncation and administered them with nimotuzumab; they found \nsuperior PFS and OS of 8.9 and 21.2 months, respectively, \ncompared to that in patients without EGFR amplification.14 \nThis was also lower than that in our study. However, they \ndid not provide comprehensive baseline data in the analysis of EGFR amplification, hence it was difficult to analyze the \nreason for the difference between our study and the results of \nthis study. Furthermore, the choice of salvage treatment after \nrelapse also influenced OS.\nDu et al enrolled 36 patients with EGFR-positive GBM \nand treated them with nimotuzumab. Based on the analysis \nof MGMT promoter methylation status, no significant differ -\nence in OS (24.5 vs. 22.9 months, P = .527) and PFS (9.1 vs. \n11.9 months, P = .752) was found between methylated and \nunmethylated patients.15 Westphal reported that patients with \nunmethylated MGMT promoter had a 4-month improvement \nin OS after treatment with nimotuzumab: 19.5 months (95% \nCI, 14.7-25.6) in the experimental group vs. 15.5 months \n(95% CI, 13.8-24.0) in the control group, P = .4578. However, \nthe authors concluded that nimotuzumab demonstrated a \nclear trend of efficacy and excellent safety in patients with \nMGMT promoter unmethylated glioblastoma.14 Our findings \nare similar to that of Westphal. Patients with unmethylated \nMGMT promoters were analyzed based on the application \nof nimotuzumab. Consequently, we found that patients who \nused nimotuzumab had significantly better PFS and OS than \nthose who did not use nimotuzumab (10.3 vs. 6.7 months, \nP = .001; 21.3 vs. 13.8, P = .001). At the same time, a Chi-\nsquare test was performed for baseline data in these 2 groups, \nand no differences were noted in age, gender, KPS score, \ndegree of tumor resection, or IDH mutation status. Thus, we \nbelieve that the combination of nimotuzumab + RT + TMZ \nhas an advantage over RT + TMZ in patients with unmethyl -\nated MGMT promoters.\nMany previous studies indicate that MGMT promoter \nmethylation is a good prognostic factor in glioblastoma.28,29 \nHere, both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed \nthat MGMT promoter methylation could significantly \ninfluence PFS and OS. In the group without nimotuzumab, \npatients with methylated MGMT promoter had signifi -\ncantly better PFS and OS than those with unmethylated \nMGMT promoter (19.3 vs. 6.7 months, P = .001; 20.2 vs. \n13.8 months, P = .026). This is also consistent with the find -\nings of previous studies. Nevertheless, in the group that was \nadministered with nimotuzumab, we found no significant \ndifference in PFS and OS between MGMT methylated and \nunmethylated patients (median PFS: 17.6 vs. 10.3 months, \nP = .077; median OS: 28.9 vs. 21.3 months, P = .278). This \nmay be attributed to the fact that nimotuzumab signifi -\ncantly improves the survival of patients with unmethylated \nMGMT promoters, hence the difference between patients T able 2.

Nonetheless, GTR did not \nshow a significant advantage in OS. This could be asso -\nciated with the aggressive treatment of our patient after \nrecurrence. Moreover, only 7 patients in our study were \nSTR, and the small sample size can potentially introduce \nbias in the results. Therefore, our findings require fur -\nther validation by subsequent studies with large samples.\nNo difference in toxicity was noted between patients who \ntook nimotuzumab and those who did not. After the com -\nbination of nimotuzumab and chemoradiotherapy, the treat -\nment-related AEs were small, and mostly grades I-II, there \nwas no grade III or higher adverse reactions. This is because \nnimotuzumab binds more to tumor cells with high EGFR \nexpression, whereas EGFR expression levels are low in nor -\nmal tissues, hence fewer adverse effects.\nOf course, our study also has certain limitations. Our \nstudy was a retrospective study with a small sample size. The \ndetermination of EGFR positivity in this study was based \non immunohistochemical analysis and could not distinguish \nbetween mutations and amplifications. In the future, we need \nto consider these factors comprehensively, expand the sample \nsize, and conduct prospective randomized controlled studies \nto verify these preliminary survival results.\nConclusion\nAccording to this single-center, retrospective, cohort study in \nChina, nimotuzumab combined with CCRT displayed supe -\nrior efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed EGFR-positive \nGBM, particularly those with unmethylated MGMT pro -\nmoter. And this combination therapy is safe and tolerable. \nHowever, a larger sample size and prospective randomized \ncontrolled studies are necessary to validate these preliminary \nsurvival results.Acknowledgments\nWe are grateful to all those who have contributed to this \nresearch.

The primary end point wasoverall survival (OS), secondary end points included time to progression, overall response rate, safety and quality of life.\nResults: A total of 192 patients were randomized, with 186 of them being assessable for efficacy and safety (average age\n63.6 years). One-year OS/progression-free survival (PFS) was 34%/22% for gem plus nimo compared with 19%/10% for gem plusplacebo (HR ¼0.69; P¼0.03/HR ¼0.68; P¼0.02). Median OS/PFS was 8.6/5.1 months for gem plus nimo versus 6.0/3.4 mo in the\ngem plus placebo group (HR ¼0.69; P¼0.0341/HR ¼0.68; P¼0.0163), with very few grade 3/4 toxicities. KRAS wildtype patients\nexperienced a significantly better OS than those with KRAS mutations (11.6 versus 5.6 months, P¼0.03).\nConclusion: This randomized study showed that nimo in combination with gem is safe and well tolerated. The 1-year OS and\nPFS rates for the entire population were significantly improved. Especially, those patients with KRAS wildtype seem to benefit.\nThe study was registered as protocol ID OSAG101-PCS07, NCT00561990 and EudraCT 2007-000338-38.\nKey words :gemcitabine, nimotuzumab, KRAS wildtype, pancreatic cancer, EGFR inhibitor\nVCThe Author 2017.

Since most patients present with advanced disease,\npalliative chemotherapy remains the treatment of choice [ 2,3].\nWith standard gemcitabine (gem), median survival in patients\nwith advanced disease is under 6 months [ 4]. The combination of\ngem with numerous cytotoxic and targeted agents did not gener-ally lead to a survival beneﬁt. Recent meta-analyses in patientswith metastatic pancreatic cancer indicate improvements in over-all survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for some\ncombination therapies [ 5,6] as 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin plus\nirinotecan plus oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) or nab-paclitaxelplus gem [ 7,8].\nIn terms of targeted therapies, only erlotinib, an inhibitor of\nthe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), added to gemshowed a marginal survival beneﬁt of 2 weeks [ 9].\nEnhanced EGFR expression occurs in both primary and meta-\nstatic pancreatic cancer in about 30%–70% of the patients [ 10],\nalthough no obvious impact of EGFR expression on survival rateswas observed [ 9]. The combination of cetuximab with gem failed\nto be more effective than gem alone [ 11].\nNimotuzumab (nimo) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal anti-\nbody against the extracellular domain of EGFR that mediates\nanti-tumor effects by its capacity to inhibit proliferation, survival\nand angiogenesis [ 12,13]. In contrast to other EGFR inhibitors,\nnimo has a very low toxicity proﬁle, which was demonstrated inprevious phase I/II studies [ 13,14]. An explanation for the low\nincidence of skin rash has emerged from several experimentalstudies. Antibodies with an intermediate afﬁnity for EGFR have a\nhigher ratio of accumulation in tissues with higher EGFR expres-\nsion levels (i.e. tumors) when compared with healthy tissues [ 15].\nIn contrast to cetuximab, the binding properties of nimotuzumabwere strongly dependent on the EGFR expression levels of tumorcells [ 13]. These ﬁndings support a greater beneﬁt of nimotuzu-\nmab in EGFR overexpressing tumors [ 18,19].\nSafety, efﬁcacy and pharmacokinetics of nimo have already\nbeen examined in a phase II trial of patients with locally advanced\nor metastatic pancreatic cancer. The dose of 400 mg was deﬁnedfor further clinical development because of pharmacokineticlimitations. Six out of the 36 patients assessable for responseshowed stable disease (median PFS 19.2 weeks). The onlytreatment-related adverse event was rash CTC grade 1 in 5 pa-\ntients [ 16], apart from constitutional symptoms possibly related\nto the underlying disease. This randomized, placebo-controlledstudy analyzes the efﬁcacy and safety of nimo in combinationwith gem for the ﬁrst-line treatment patients with advanced ormetastatic pancreatic cancer.\nPatients and methods\nStudy design\nThis multi-institutional, placebo-controlled, randomized phase IIb trial\nwas sponsored by Oncoscience AG, Wedel, Germany, with patients\nincluded into the trial between 2007 and 2011. Data were collected by the\nsponsor and were analyzed by a bio-statistician (CRM Biometrics\nGmbH, Rheinbach, Germany). An independent data and safety monitor-\ning committee reviewed efﬁcacy and safety data. The study was done inaccordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave their writ-\nten informed consent. The institutional ethic committees at each site re-\nviewed and approved the protocol. The study sponsor had no role in the\nstudy design, analysis, interpretation, writing, or the decision to submit\nfor publication. The senior author had full access to all study data andﬁnal responsibility for the publication.\nPatients\nChemotherapy-naı ¨ve patients with locally advanced or metastatic pan-\ncreatic cancer were eligible for this multi-institutional, randomized trial\nif they had histologically or cytologically conﬁrmed locally advanced ormetastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas not amenable to curative\nradiotherapy or surgery. Patients with measurable disease as deﬁned by\nResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 and\nsufﬁcient organ functions were evaluated by the respective laboratory\nand imaging tests, and physical examinations. Patients had to be at least18 years of age, with a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) /C2170%, and an\nestimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Patients were excluded if\nthey had any prior anticancer chemotherapy including adjuvant gem for\npancreatic cancer, any investigational agent received concurrently or\nwithin the last 30 days, major surgery within the previous 3 weeks, symp-tomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases, previous or concurrent ma-\nlignancy other than pancreatic cancer, uncontrolled ascites, or other\nclinically signiﬁcant co-morbidities.\nRandomization and treatment\nEligible patients were randomly assigned to both gem and nimo or togem and placebo, double-blinded in a one-to-one ratio. Randomization\nwas carried out centrally ensuring equal distribution of patients on the\nbasis of measurable lesions (locally advanced only versus metastatic dis-\nease). Brieﬂy, patients received gem 1000 mg/m\n2(i.v., 30-min infusion)\nonce weekly for 3 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest; and either additionalnimo 400 mg ﬁxed dose weekly or placebo, both administered i.v. as a 30-\nmin infusion. Treatment was continued until death, progressive disease,\nunacceptable toxicity, patient’s refusal or investigator’s decision. Physical\nexaminations, hematologic and biochemical tests were carried out at\nweekly intervals in both treatment groups. All adverse events were moni-tored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology\nCriteria (NCI-CTC) for Adverse Events (version 3.0). Treatment re-\nsponses (according to RECIST version 1.0) were assessed by CT/MRI inweek 8, 16, 24 and thereafter every 8 weeks until disease progression.\nQuality of life (QoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 at baseline\nand 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 weeks thereafter.\nThe primary end point was OS, secondary end points were PFS, overall\nresponse rate (ORR), duration of response (DR) and QoL, pain measure-\nment (pain intensity, analgesic consumption) and safety (adverse events,\nclinical laboratory assessments).\nStatistical analyses\nThe population for all analyses was deﬁned based on the full-analysis (FAS)\npopulation that was deﬁned as all patients, excluding patients who withdrewinformed consent before any study sp eciﬁc treatment started, or patients\nabout whom it became known a maximum of 4 weeks after randomization\nthat major in/exclusion criteria were violated. Brieﬂy, the primary end pointOS was assessed in a conﬁrmatory stati stical analysis based on a two-sided\nstatistical hypothesis test, determined from the date of randomization until\ndeath or last date of follow-up [ 17]. A two-sided log-rank test for equality of\nsurvival curves was used at a 5% signiﬁcance level. Additionally, a one-sided\nlog-rank test at a signiﬁcance level of 5% for superiority was carried out assecondary analysis. The secondary end point time to tumor progression\n(TTP) was measured from the date of randomization to the occurrence\nof progression or death or to the last date of observation without progres-\nsion or to death when relation to progression could be excluded. According\nto this deﬁnition, TTP corresponded to PFS commonly used forOriginal articleAnnals of Oncology\n2430 | Schultheis et al.

PFS and OS were descr ibed using the Kaplan–Meier method.\nCorrespondingly, 95% conﬁdence intervals were calculated for the median\nand speciﬁed survival rates (6 and 12 months). Further evaluation was car-ried out using Cox’s regression model. All other analyses were carried out\nwith an explorative aim. An increase in OS by 3 months or an increase in\nPFS by 2 months was to be considered as clinically relevant.\nResults\nPatients\nA total of 192 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pan-\ncreatic cancer were enrolled from 16 study centers in Germany,Turkey, and Switzerland and randomly assigned to either gemplus nimo ( n¼96 patients) or to gem plus placebo ( n¼96 pa-\ntients) (see Figure 1, CONSORT diagram). Demographic and\nclinical characteristics at baseline as well as KRAS status and\nEGFR-expression are shown in Table 1.\nStudy treatment\nThe median duration of treatment was 4 cycles (range 1–21) in\nthe nimo plus gem group, each lasting 28 days, and 3 cycles(range 1–22) in the gem plus placebo group. (The main reasonfor treatment discontinuation was disease progression.)\nObservation time\nThe observation time of 1 year was chosen in order to deﬁne iden-tical conditions of analysis for all patients, especially in order toavoid interactions through second-line treatments, which 71% ofall study patients received. Furthermore, 72% of the patients diedduring the ﬁrst year; 63% in the gem plus nimo group and 80% in\nthe gem plus placebo group.

In addition, the OS rate after 12 months was signiﬁ-\ncantly higher with gem plus nimo compared with gem plus placebo(34% versus 19%, P¼0.03). At 18 months, OS rates were 17% ver-\ns u s9 %f o rg e mp l u sn i m oa n dg e mp l u s þplacebo, respectively\n(P¼0.07), suggesting maximal efﬁcacy of the nimotuzumab com-\nbination between 6 and 18 months after randomization (Table 2).\nProgression-free survival\nThe median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI 3.7–6.8) for gem plus\nnimo versus 3.4 months (95% CI 2.5–4.0) for gem plus placebo(hazard ratio 0.68; P¼0.02). The rate of PFS at 1-year was 22%\nin the gem plus nimo group, when compared with 10% in the\ngem plus placebo group (Figure 3).\nResponse rates\nThe objective response rates were not different among the treatment\ngroups (partial response rate 8.6% for each group). However, therate of disease control (conﬁrmed response or stable disease for/C2116 weeks) was 63% in the gemcitabine þnimotuzumab group\nand 52% in the gemcitabine þplacebo group (Table 2).\nSubgroup analyses\nLocally advanced versus metastatic patients. Patients with locally\nadvanced disease usually have a better prognosis compared withpatients showing metastatic disease. We therefore analyzed themseparately. No difference was seen in OS and PFS rates betweenthe two treatment arms for patients with locally advanced disease\nonly. Metastatic patients treated with gem plus nimo had a\n12-mo survival beneﬁt (26.1% versus 14.5% with gem plus pla-cebo) ( P¼0.04). Similar results were obtained for PFS rates\n(P¼0.02) (Table 2).Molecular biomarkers. Tissue sample of 97 patients were avail-\nable. A total of 49 patients in the gem plus nimo group and 48 pa-tients in the gem plus placebo group underwent molecular\nanalyses by real-time PCR (LightCycler\nVR) for KRAS mutations\nand EGFR-expression. Patients with KRAS wildtype had an OS\nbeneﬁt at 12 months ( P¼0.026) in the gem plus þnimo group\ncompared with the gem plus placebo group, whereas results forEGFR-overexpression just reach statistical signiﬁcance (Table 2).\nAdverse events and QoL\nCommon adverse events across both treatment groups were gen-\nerally grade 1–2. Hematologic adverse events were very similarfor both groups, with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia grade\nbeing slightly more frequent in the experimental arm (see supple\nmentary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). Here,\nthe most frequent non-hematologic adverse events were fatigue(21.5% of patients, one patient grade 3), pyrexia (in 16.1%), chills(in 11.8%) and rash (in 15.1%, two patients grade 3). In addition,the proportion of patients with at least one serious adverse event\nwas comparable across the two treatment groups (58.1% for gem\nplus nimo versus 65.6% for gem plus placebo). Quality-of-life as-sessments did not show statistically signiﬁcant differences in bothtreatment arms (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nThis randomized study showed that in the entire study popula-tion, gem combined with nimo is safe and well tolerated with asigniﬁcantly improved overall and PFS at 12 months. Even at18 months, OS rates are still superior for the combination treat-ment, but did not reach statistical signiﬁcance anymore. This is\nmost likely due to the high number of events during the ﬁrst\n12 months. Moreover, survival beneﬁt beyond 12 months wasprobably confounded by second-line therapies (more than 40%per arm), as patients were allowed to switch over to any further100 Percent surviving95\n90858075\n7065\n6055504540353025201510\n5\n0\n0123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2\nSurvival time (months)Experimental\nControl\nFigure 2.

Because no standard\nsecond-line therapy was deﬁned in pancreatic cancer patients, wedid not perform further analysis on this issue. In our study, me-dian OS was improved by 2.6 months in the gem þnimo group,\nwith gem monotherapy being the standard treatment at the time\nof study initiation and being still an option for patients in\nreduced overall condition or suffering from co-morbidities.Within the protocol, we considered a 2-month increase in PFS asclinically signiﬁcant, which was just missed, while a 3.6-monthincrease in OS can be considered as clinically relevant. However,the published median OS for pancreatic cancer treated with gem\n(6–7 months) in two large phase III trials ﬁts well with what we\ncould conﬁrm in our patient cohort. At the time of study design,neither nab-paclitaxel nor FOLFIRINOX were standards of ther-apy yet. A large, randomized phase III study of nab-paclitaxelplus gem versus gem led to a median improvement in OS of1.8 months [ 8]. The phase 2–3 trial of FOLFIRINOX versus gem\nalso showed an improvement in median survival by 4.3 months[7]. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher in 46% of FOLFIRINOX-\ntreated patients suggest that this regimen is an option only for pa-tients with a good performance status [ 7].\nIn contrast, the safety proﬁle for the gem plus nimo combin-\nation was favorable and comparable with the placebo arm. Chills,\nfatigue und pyrexia were slightly more frequent for the gem plus\nnimo group. Nimotuzumab was not associated with additionalhematologic adverse events and only 15% of the patients experi-enced skin toxicity, mostly grade 1–2. Patients with signiﬁcant co-morbidities are usually not candidates for more toxic regimens likethose mentioned above. Molecular targeted drugs have been exten-\nsively evaluated in pancreatic cancer, but the EGFR inhibitor erlo-\ntinib was the only compound showing a minor increase in survivalwhen combined with gem [ 9]. Cetuximab, another anti-EGFR\nmonoclonal antibody, failed to improve survival in a randomizedtrial, however, without stratiﬁcation to KRAS status [ 11].\nThe reported frequency of KRAS -WT in pancreatic cancer is\n/C2410%–30%, and in our study the percentage is considerableTable 2.

It is well documented, thatanti-EGFR-Abs failed in tumors with KRAS -mutations.\nTherefore, as expected, OS rates of patients with KRAS wildtype\nin the nimotuzumab group were signiﬁcantly better comparedwith patients with KRAS mutations, consistent with cetuximab\nstudies in colorectal cancer [ 19]. A phase II adjuvant trial in pan-\ncreatic cancer trial recently had shown a trend toward better sur-vival in cetuximab-treated KRAS wildtype patients [ 20]. We\ntherefore suggest antibody-based anti-EGFR-strategies in prese-\nlected RAS-WT pancreatic cancer patients for future clinical trials.\nMany agents that have shown promising results in phase II tri-\nals in pancreatic cancer eventually failed in phase III trials.Therefore, a limitation of this study is that the total number ofpatients is not powered for a regular phase III study.Nevertheless, this randomized study showed a signiﬁcant im-\nprovement in PFS and OS using gem in combination with nimo.\nA randomized phase III trial is planned to evaluate its beneﬁt inKRAS wildtype patients, with extended biomarker analysis to in-\nvestigate the molecular biology in this patient cohort.\nFunding\nThis multi-institutional, randomized phase IIb trial was spon-sored by Oncoscience AG, Wedel (recently Schenefeld),Germany.

In addition, cetuximab concurrent with \nRT regimen was associated with a higher rate of ≥3 AEs than RT, suggesting that the \nrecommendation grade in future NCCN guidelines needs to be adjusted or removed\nCIMa Her  \nnimotuzumab 50 mg Systematic Review of R/M SCCHN Treatment Options\nIn summary, IMT (Immunotherapy) appears to be paving the frontier of R/M HNSCC \ntreatment  but its routine use is hindered by its expense and the challenge of selecting \npatients who will truly benefit . EGFR inhibitors may remain a reasonable choice  for \nthose not eligible for IMT; however systemic therapy should ultimately employ an \nindividualized approach  to optimize treatment outcomes.\nCIMa Her  \nnimotuzumab 50 mg Clinical Evidences of Nimotuzumab for R/M SCCHN \nProspective, Interventional, Non -Randomized, Comparative Study\nN = 124 patients\nCIMa Her  \nnimotuzumab 50 mg Study design\nNIMOTUZUMAB ARM\nNimotuzumab weekly 200 mg \n+ \npaclitaxel 135 -175 mg/m2 or docetaxel 75 \nmg/m2 \n+ \ncisplatin 60 -75 mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC 5) \n3 weeklyCONTROL ARM\nPaclitaxel 135 -175 mg/m2 or docetaxel 75 \nmg/m2 \n+ \ncisplatin 60 -75 mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC 5, \n3 weekly\nStandard treatment was defined as six cycles, \nunless there was disease progression or unacceptable toxicity\nCIMa Her  \nnimotuzumab 50 mg\nResult\nResponse Nimotuzumab Arm  n (%) Control Arm  n (%)\nComplete response 2 (3.6%) 2 (3.4%)\nPartial response 19 (34.5%) 9 (15.5%)\nStable disease 20 (36.4%) 14 (24.1%)\nDisease progression 33 (56.9%) 14 (25.5%) 33 (56.9%) \nORR (CR + PR) 11 (19%) 21 (38.2%) 11 (19%)\nDisease control rate (CR + PR + \nSD)35 (74.5%) 25 (43.1%)\nNimotuzumab  improve overall response rate \nCIMa Her  \nnimotuzumab 50 mgProgression Free Survival\nPFS = 5.2 months vs 3.2 months\np = 0.00763\nCIMa Her  \nnimotuzumab 50 mg\nToxicity\nThe addition of Nimotuzumab to \nchemotherapy did not add on to \ntoxicity.\nThe excellent safety profile has been \nobserved. \nCIMa Her  \nnimotuzumab 50 mg\nComparison with other studies\nThe major finding in our study was that nimotuzumab displayed efficacy \nwithout producing clinically significant toxicity  which is typical to other \nmonoclonal antibodies.
